But as long as his popularity ratings don\\'t drop dramatically, he\\'s likely to get confirmed.\\n\\nUsually, Supreme Court nominees are well liked even after intense confirmation hearings. Just after Kavanaugh was announced, I collected the final popularity ratings for all Supreme Court nominees since Robert Bork before their confirmation vote or withdrawal. (No poll was taken about Anthony Kennedy.)\\n\\nThe average net approval or favorability rating for these nominees was 20 percentage points.\\n\\nKavanaugh\\'s net favorabilty rating is just above zero right now. No nominee who was as unpopular as Kavanaugh is currently has been confirmed in the modern era. Harriet Miers withdrew her nomination after being chosen by President George W. Bush, while Bork was voted down after being nominated by President Ronald Reagan.\\n\\nKavanaugh\\'s low popularity certainly limits his potential to grab Democratic votes. Once we control for factors such as a nominee\\'s qualifications and her or his ideological distance from each senator, a nominee\\'s popularity has impacted how many votes they receive for confirmation. One of President George H.W. Bush\\'s picks, Clarence Thomas, for example, probably wouldn\\'t have been confirmed without his strong popularity ratings.\\n\\nThe problem for those hoping that Kavanaugh goes down is that popularity isn\\'t the only thing that matters. Miers withdrew mostly because conservatives complained about her qualifications . Bork was voted down by a Democrat-controlled Senate because his conservative record was so extensive.\\n\\nKavanaugh has neither of those problems. He has been rated as \"well-qualified\" by the American Bar Association. Kavanaugh also will be voted upon by a Senate that is controlled by Republicans.\\n\\nWhen you combine the makeup of the Senate and Kavanaugh\\'s judicial profile, his current popularity rating is probably not low enough to make any Republicans vote against him. He may even pick up a Democratic vote.\\n\\nNow, the potentially good news for Democrats is that nominees do tend to see their popularity drop after a confirmation hearing.\\n\\nBork, for example, initially had a one-point net favorability rating in a Times Mirror poll. That\\'s more than 10 points higher than where his popularity rating ended up in a Los Angeles Times poll before the Senate voted him down.\\n\\nWhen I previously wrote on Kavanaugh, I noted that a Bork-like popularity might be low enough for Kavanaugh to get voted down. Specifically, it would on average lead to him getting 49 votes in favor compared to 50 votes against.\\n\\nThat, however, was back when Sen. John McCain was not healthy enough to be in Washington to vote on Kavanaugh\\'s confirmation. In other words, back when Republicans really had only 50 senators to the Democrats\\' 49.\\n\\nThis week, Republican Jon Kyl was sworn in to fill McCain\\'s seat. Kyl has a conservative voting record and was Kavanaugh\\'s sherpa (i.e. the experienced Washington insider to guide him through the confirmation process ). There is pretty much no chance that Kyl would vote against Kavanaugh. That brings Kavanaugh to 50 votes on average in a hypothetical scenario in which his popularity matches the worst polling nominee on record by the end of the confirmation process.\\n\\nI guess it\\'s possible that Kavanaugh could become even more unpopular than Bork was. In this highly partisan environment in which potential justices are far less likely to reveal their stances on matters of judicial importance than they were back when Bork was under consideration, it seems unlikely, however, that Kavanaugh\\'s public numbers would move that much.\\n\\nIt\\'s also possible that Kyl\\'s connection to Kavanaugh might make him abstain from voting on him. Again though, that seems more like a Democratic fantasy than a potential reality.\\n\\nThe bottom line is that with 51 Republican senators, he\\'s very likely to land on the Supreme Court.', 'clickbait': array(['0'], dtype='<U1')}\n",

Michael Capuano in the Democratic primary for a seat that has been held by the likes of John F. Kennedy and Tip O\\'Neill in the past.\\n\\nPressley ran as an unapologetic liberal, calling for the impeachment of President Donald Trump and the abolishing of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. She was endorsed by the likes of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez -- the only other challenger to beat a Democratic House incumbent so far in 2018 -- and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, a rising national star among liberals.\\n\\nIn short, Pressley\\'s win had all the hallmarks of Ocasio-Cortez\\'s victory over the summer -- a liberal insurgent candidate catches a more moderate, establishment member of Congress off-guard. Except that\\'s not what happened here. At all.\\n\\nStart with the fact that Capuano is no one\\'s idea of a moderate. According to VoteView ratings , Capuano is the 15th most liberal member of Congress -- and the most liberal member of the not-very-conservative Massachusetts delegation. That makes him more liberal than Nancy Pelosi (32nd) and close to as liberal as Maxine Waters (4th). Compare that to Rep. Joe Crowley, the Democrat that Ocasio-Cortez beat. Crowley was the 78th most liberal member, according to VoteView\\n\\nSo if Capuano didn\\'t lose because he wasn\\'t liberal enough, why did he lose? Two reasons.\\n\\n1. Tone\\n\\nThis primary didn\\'t turn on the incumbent member of Congress voting in ways that were inconsistent with the wants and needs of his district. It was about what kind of liberalism voters in the Boston-area district wanted. Capuano\\'s was a quiet liberalism; he always voted the right way for a district where Hillary Clinton won 83% of the vote in 2016, but he wasn\\'t an activist. He wasn\\'t demanding change. He wasn\\'t storming the barricades. That was the sort of liberalism that Pressley promised. \"This district and these times demand more than just an ally, they demand an advocate and a champion,\" she said in announcing her candidacy . \"Making progress on longstanding challenges requires a different lens and a new approach.\"\\n\\nIn the wake of Clinton\\'s loss to Trump in 2016, many liberals concluded that while the former secretary of state was with them on issues, she was too tonally moderate -- unwilling to talk about things like single-payer health care, for instance, for fear of alienating voters in the ideological middle. Pressley, Ocasio-Cortez and newly minted Florida governor nominee Andrew Gillum are all liberals on the more activist end of the spectrum -- a reflection of what the Democratic Party base wants right now.\\n\\nOne example that illustrates the tonal difference between Capuano and Pressley: Trump impeachment. Capuano spent much of 2017 urging caution for Democrats who wanted articles of impeachment brought against Trump. \"We have to respect the process,\" the Boston Globe quoted Capuano writing in a May 2017 newsletter . \"It shouldn\\'t be a witch hunt or a political statement.\" While Capuano eventually came around and voted for a measure that would have begun the impeachment process against Trump, he was dogged by the idea he was only doing so out of reaction to Pressley\\'s challenge. Of Trump\\'s impeachment, Pressley said : \"I\\'d cast that vote, but a vote is not enough. As leaders we have to ask ourselves as we navigate this new and dangerous terrain together -- how do we resist and progress at the same time?\"\\n\\n2. The Democratic Party\\'s changing face\\n\\nBoston -- and the Democratic Party -- is in the midst of a massive transformation from a working class, largely white majority into a far more racially and ethnically diverse one. As the Almanac of American Politics notes , Boston was a 95% white city in 1950; it is now 25% black and 19% Hispanic. The Almanac also notes that Boston is now populated by \"young singles in rowhouse apartments, professionals in waterfront apartment towers and African-Americans in old triple-deckers.\"\\n\\nWhile Pressley bristled at the idea that she was running primarily as a black candidate, the fact that she was a young, African-American woman (Pressley is 44) and Capuano was an older white man (he is 66) was obvious. And rhetorically, Pressley pushed the idea that she was the new face of a new Boston -- not exactly a racial appeal, but one clearly aimed at suggesting that Capuano represented a Democratic Party that no longer exists.\\n\\n\"This is a fight for the soul of our party and the future of our democracy,\" Pressley said in the campaign . \"This is a disruptive candidacy, a grassroots coalition. It is broad and diverse and deep. People of every walk of life.\"\\n\\nPressley\\'s win -- as well as the victory of Ocasio-Cortez, a female Puerto Rican-American candidate -- speak to that more diverse coalition within the party. As Cook Political Report House editor David Wasserman noted in a tweet on Tuesday night\\n\\n\"The share of House Rs who are white men is 86% and rising.\\n\\n\"The share of House Dems who are white men is 41% and falling.\"\\n\\nMake no mistake: The energy of the Democratic Party is on the left. But it\\'s not that simple. Democrats don\\'t just want to nominate liberals. They want to nominate liberals who a) are ready to fight President Trump on literally everything and b) who look more like the new base of the Democratic Party.\\n\\nThose are the lessons of Ayanna Pressley\\'s win that ambitious 2020 Democrats need to learn.', 'clickbait': array(['0'], dtype='<U1')}\n",

There was at least one demonstrable outcome from this trip: a date for the next inter-Korean summit between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in, September 18 to 20 in Pyongyang.\\n\\nIt\\'s an auspicious time for the Hermit Kingdom. On Sunday it will mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic People\\'s Republic of Korea.\\n\\nTalks between Washington and Pyongyang have stalled.

Absent mechanisms for on the ground verification for inspectors, we cannot confirm that North Korea has taken any other denuclearization steps at this time,\" Coats said Tuesday. \"This North Korean commitment, and I put \\'commitment\\' in parantheses -- to denuclearize presents a huge and critical challenge to our intelligence community -- complete and accurate collection and analyses is essential to achieve our long standing goals.\"\\n\\nCoats\\' comments exemplify the differences between the two nations regarding what each side considers to be active steps on the path to denuclearization.

Last year it bought Whole Foods, and it recently bought online pharmacy Pillpack. Some rumors say Amazon may want to move even further into the media business and buy the Landmark movie theater chain.\\n\\nAnd Forte thinks there are two other areas of retail that could also help lift the Jeff Bezos-led company to a $2 trillion market cap: gas stations and travel.\\n\\nGoing after Costco and Priceline?\\n\\nForte argued in a recent report that Amazon could emulate the model of Costco (COST), which owns and operates gas stations at some of its giant warehouse stores.\\n\\nHe added that the company could offer discounts on fuel to lure drivers who are also Amazon Prime subscribers.\\n\\nBut it\\'s not clear how Amazon would enter the gas station business. Many of its Amazon-branded stores are smaller, urban ones that don\\'t lend themselves to having a gas station.\\n\\nAnother possibility could be opening gas stations at larger, suburban Whole Foods locations.\\n\\nAs for travel, Amazon actually already attempted to get into that business. But its Amazon Destinations site lasted only a few months in 2015 before being shut down.\\n\\nForte thinks that Amazon could try again, and offer services ranging from discounts on cruises and rental cars to airline tickets and hotel reservations. He said Amazon could consider a rival to home sharing site Airbnb, as well.\\n\\nHe\\'s not the only one on Wall Street that thinks Amazon may make another run at the travel business. Morgan Stanley put out a report in March suggesting that Amazon may go after the likes of Priceline owner Booking Holdings (BKNG) and its rival Expedia (EXPE).\\n\\nForte said Amazon\\'s burgeoning gaming business, led by video site Twitch, could also give a big boost to Amazon.\\n\\nIn fact, Forte cited the opportunity from eSports as a reason why he raised his near-term price target on Wednesday to $2,450 a share. That\\'s almost 25% higher than the current stock price and would value at Amazon at about $1.2 trillion.\\n\\nFiring on all cylinders\\n\\nBut Amazon would have to more than double to get to $2 trillion, which isn\\'t far fetched.\\n\\nThe stock did just that over the past 12 months, and it\\'s soared nearly 600% in just the past five years.\\n\\nIf Amazon continues to post impressive earnings growth over the next few years, then $2 trillion may not seem out of the question.\\n\\nThat\\'s why one money manager who focuses on growth stocks also prefers Amazon over Apple.\\n\\n\"Amazon continues to fire on all cylinders,\" said Matt Benkendorf, chief investment officer of Vontobel Quality Growth. \"This is unequivocally a franchise that gets stronger as it gets bigger.\"\\n\\nBenkendorf added that Amazon\\'s big investments on Amazon Web Services and its retail operations are starting to yield sizable profits.

By Evelyn Creekmore\\n\\nWas this helpful? ( 8 )\\n\\nNearly a third of people diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have stage 3 of the disease. In most cases, the cancer can’t be removed successfully through surgery. But “most” doesn’t mean “all,” and other powerful treatments are available. Having surgery doesn’t always equal having the best treatment. A key characteristic of stage 3 lung cancer is the variety of forms it can take. A critical component of your lung cancer care is a personalized treatment plan developed by a team of specialists.\\n\\nWilliam C. Lloyd III, MD, FACS Medical Reviewers: 2018 Healthgrades Operating Company, Inc. All rights reserved. May not be reproduced or reprinted without permission from Healthgrades Operating Company, Inc. Use of this information is governed by the Healthgrades User Agreement.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat Is Your Stage 3 Lung Cancer Subtype?\\n\\nAlmost a quarter of a million people are estimated to be diagnosed with NSCLC this year. Lung cancer doctors stage NSCLC based on the size of your tumor and how far the cancer has spread. An important consideration is whether or not your lymph nodes are involved. Stage 3 lung cancer can mean one of these three things:\\n\\nThe tumor size is between five and seven centimeters.\\n\\nThere is more than one tumor in the same lobe of the lung. (The right lung has three lobes; the left lung has two.)\\n\\nThe cancer has spread to nerves close to the lungs, the cover of the heart (pericardium), or areas of the chest such as the ribs, diaphragm, or muscles.\\n\\nOnce your lung cancer care team has evaluated all these factors, your stage 3 lung cancer will be further defined as sub-type A or B. This refinement helps inform treatment decisions, but it doesn’t dictate them. Remember, there’s a wide range of lung cancer scenarios , and your body is unique. Stage 3A lung NSCLC may be operable, but stage 3B is not.\\n\\nLung Cancer Treatment for Stage 3A Lung Cancer\\n\\nIn stage 3A NSCLC, the cancer has spread to specific lymph nodes near your lungs, but hasn’t spread to other parts of your body. Your treatment plan for stage 3A NSCLC may include:\\n\\nSurgery\\n\\nChemotherapy\\n\\nRadiation therapy\\n\\nTargeted therapy, medicines that reach specific cells to stop cancer from growing or reduce the size of tumors\\n\\nImmunotherapy (biologics), medicines that work with your body’s immune system to attack cancer cells\\n\\nLung cancer specialists often recommend beginning treatment with a combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. If any cancer remains and can be removed, surgery may be an option. In some cases, surgery is performed as a first step.\\n\\nTypes of surgery include:\\n\\nLobectomy, the removal of a lobe of the lung that is cancerous\\n\\nWedge resection or segmentectomy, two different types of procedures for removing part of a lobe when the entire lobe can’t be removed\\n\\nPneumonectomy, the removal of one entire lung, which may be necessary if a tumor is near the middle of your chest\\n\\nLung Cancer Treatment for Stage 3B Lung Cancer\\n\\nIn Stage 3B NSCLC, the cancer has spread to lymph nodes near your lungs or neck. It may also have spread to your chest. Surgical procedures can’t remove this cancer completely, so chemotherapy and radiation therapy are often used alone or in combination. These treatments may be able to kill cancer cells when surgery can’t. If they don’t, targeted therapy and immunotherapy offer additional options.\\n\\nThere are more non-surgical treatment alternatives for lung cancer today than ever before, research is ongoing, and survival rates are improving. Ask your doctor to keep you up-to-date and see if you’re eligible for clinical trials that test the latest treatments. All treatments, including surgery, come with benefits and risks. Look to your doctor to explain them, help you weigh them, and navigate the best way forward.', 'clickbait': array(['0'], dtype='<U1')}\n",

In addition, they believe Stinson\\'s injuries were self-inflicted.\\n\\nHer story prompted a statewide Amber Alert. Investigators even released a composite sketch of the alleged suspect, based on Stinson\\'s description.\\n\\n\\n\\nAlleged suspect composite sketch\\n\\nWhen asked why she took the ride from \"Antwan,\" Stinson told police it was because Jordan was kind of heavy and she didn\\'t want to have to carry him all the way to her destination.\\n\\nAs the search for Jordan continued, ABC Action News learned authorities were at the Stinson\\'s apartment on Sunday picking up evidence and trying to determine when was the last time Jordan was there.\\n\\nPolice later told ABC Action News they discovered bloody children’s items inside of the apartment. On Monday, they took those items into evidence but said they were not certain if they were connected to Jordan’s disappearance.\\n\\nJordan’s mother told investigators her son cut his chin and recently received stitches for the injury. Detectives also took a few items of children’s clothing into evidence Tuesday which were found rolled up in a rug outside of Jordan’s mother’s apartment.\\n\\nStinson was arrested shortly after 8:30 p.m. Tuesday and charged with First Degree Murder in the death of Jordan.\\n\\n\\n\\nCharisse Stinson, 21\\n\\nABC Action News reached out to Jordan’s father, who was too distraught to speak with us.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t speak on how my brother feels because I never lost a child. I just know my brother is devoted right now,\" said Stephon Davis, the child\\'s uncle. \"I just want my nephew to be laid in peace and his mama and whoever involved in this, justice.”\\n\\nDigging into court documents, ABC Action News discovered that Stinson and Jordan\\'s father had a history of domestic battery. A Largo arrest report from July stated that Jordan\\'s father drove the boy to Stinson\\'s home, to exchange custody of Jordan. According to the report, Stinson \"did not want the child yet,\" which caused an argument that became physical when the father punched Stinson.\\n\\nThe Department of Children and Families could not release any information on the case, saying in part, “The loss of this child is profoundly saddening. We are actively working with the Pinellas County Sheriff\\'s Office and the Largo Police Department during the course of their criminal investigation. Pinellas County Sheriff\\'s Office conducts all child protective investigations in Pinellas County, not DCF.”', 'clickbait': array(['0'], dtype='<U1')}\n",

He joined forces with freelance journalist, Brandon Smith, who filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requesting all video from that night.\\n\\n“Eleven other folks had requested before me,” Smith said. “They represented nine other news organizations. All were denied.”\\n\\nSmith turned to Attorney Matt Topic, who specializes in suing agencies that deny FOIAs.\\n\\n“The conventional wisdom was that if there was a pending investigation, you weren’t going to get anything out of the police department and I knew that was not the law,” said Topic, explaining why he decided to take the case.\\n\\nTopic filed a lawsuit in August of 2015. Three months later, a judge ordered the release of the video, but it was more than a year after the shooting. That led to a federal investigation of the Chicago Police Department.\\n\\n“The Chicago Police Department engages in a pattern in practice of use of excessive force,” stated Former U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch.\\n\\nSmith said, “The city is totally different because of this case.”\\n\\nA major change is a public portal, established in June 2016 where anyone can view videos of cases under investigation.\\n\\nWith confirmation from a former investigator with the Independent Police Review Authority, CBS 2 Investigators discovered that out of 124 cases with video currently on the portal, only one appears to have been released to the public before the McDonald tape – the 2011 case of Flit Farmer, an unarmed man shot seven times.\\n\\nMore changes include the usage of body cameras for patrol. The policy mandates release of videos “within 60 days of their occurrence.”\\n\\n“Two months is a long time to wait before knowing what happened,” said Smith, arguing the law requires police to respond to FOIAs in 10 business days. Calloway’s complaint is that even when police release tapes, many times the audio is missing. In the recent case of Harith Augustus, initially police only released 30 seconds.\\n\\n“That’s something we didn’t like,” said Calloway.\\n\\nWhen asked why the police department doesn’t release all of the video the first time, Supt. Eddie Johnson replied, “The video has to be viewed before release and sometimes it’s a lot to view,” adding it could possibly impact the investigation. “For instance, if the video shows a witness. If we show their face too quickly we may not be able to interview them.”\\n\\nChicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson supports releasing videos because he sees an upside for officers. In the Harith Augustus shooting, the video showed that Augustus had a gun.\\n\\n“They thought police had shot an unarmed man five times in the back and that video proved it was not the case,” Johnson said.\\n\\nSome hope the release of the McDonald video has a lasting impact.\\n\\nA 230 page draft consent decree outlines an agreement between the city and the Illinois Attorney General, and recommends sweeping reforms aimed at addressing police misconduct.\\n\\n“I want police to be held to the same justice system you and I are held to,” said Smith.\\n\\nCalloway added that he would like to see the police tapes released faster and immediately, upon request.\\n\\nSupt.

Now, it\\'s transforming into a place for good -- providing a community and safety net for kids aging out of foster care.\\n\\n\"(We\\'re) building the safety net for the youth that are coming out so that as they age, and as they develop, and as they\\'re working, and programs are being developed for them, we\\'ll help them stay in the job,\" said Ed Shada, president of Angels Share, the group heading the project.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nShada said his vision for the campus was never about bringing in another college. His plans to take care of the less fortunate have always been the focus, despite Grace University\\'s closure announcement. The university had planned to utilize a portion of the campus.\\n\\nThat didn\\'t stop Shada from pursuing his goal. Through community partnerships and businesses, he\\'s now months away from giving youth a place to live, work and grow.\\n\\nPeople gathered to pray for the property\\'s next chapter Tuesday evening in the Trinity Chapel on campus.\\n\\n\"We pray that you would bless every effort to realize the vision of reaching vulnerable people,\" the pastor said. \"That lives would be renewed and that there would be a future and hope for all those who come together in this place.\"\\n\\nThe redevelopment project on the campus is called Transformation Hill. On it will be the Frank Krejci Learning and Life Center, named after Frank Krejci, who donated the land. Shada designed the center to help youth in need.\\n\\n\"We\\'re really wanting to develop the youth, to develop those that want to work,\" Shada said. The center will \"give them an opportunity to get on their feet and give them jobs.\"\\n\\nRight now, Shada is transforming the former quad housing building on campus into low-income apartments. It will be the first building youth move into.\\n\\nAs renovations are underway at the apartments, Project Everlast and other community partners are starting to determine which youth would make a good fit to live in them.\\n\\n\"The only thing that a kid in foster care can manage is a day-to-day existence and so they come out already strides behind,\" said Ronda Newman, associate vice president of Project Everlast Omaha.\\n\\nProject Everlast works with metro youth aging out of foster care and connects them with area resources in the community that can help them find housing and jobs, along with other types of support.\\n\\nNewman said just last Friday she and other providers met to talk about what the youth who could benefit from the Frank Krejci Learning and Life Center might look like.\\n\\n\"Somewhere between 18-26, just because those are the ages that we see most often here, ones that are struggling,\" Newman said. \"We\\'d like to see young people that have some sort of drive. Something that they want to get somewhere, but they don\\'t quite know how to do that.\"\\n\\nOnce they move in, local businesses including Sterling Transportation Services are eager to train the youth and help them find jobs.\\n\\n\"There is a huge need industrywide for truck drivers and a lot of it is a good base of the driver population is retiring,\" said Tracy Jahnel, controller at Sterling Transportation Services.\\n\\nJahnel said there\\'s not just a need behind the wheel, but also for diesel technicians.\\n\\nSterling Transportation is still working out the details, but Jahnel said the business wants to be involved in training the youth on campus and helping them find careers.\\n\\n\"Good, young, professional drivers that have been trained properly and that get into the field early, they\\'re going to be a blessing down the road,\" Jahnel said.\\n\\nOther community businesses including Woodhouse are also involved in the project. Young people will be exposed to job opportunities in transportation, trade and automotive fields.\\n\\n\"The community is rallying around these young adults and getting them on the right path,\" Jahnel said. \"That says so much. It gives them a chance. The vision is there and, you know, the amount of good that can come out of this -- sky\\'s the limit.\"\\n\\nThe city of Blair and private developers are also involved in the Transformation Hill Development. They purchased land and are in the process of building workforce housing. The community will be able to live in the housing and, Shada said, the hope is that some of the youth living in the apartments can eventually transition into the workforce housing.\\n\\n\"They have an opportunity to really get back on their feet, get established, get a savings account built up, work with people to develop their lives,\" Shada said.\\n\\nThe city contributed $1.8 million in tax increment financing funding to help cover the cost to tear down old buildings and build new housing.\\n\\nShada said they\\'re in the first phase of the project, which includes renovating the former dorm that will serve as apartments for the youth. At least four buildings on campus have already been torn down, including the married housing dorms. The former girls and boys dorms are also in the process of being torn down.\\n\\nShada is renovating and utilizing some of the former buildings. The gym and library will soon be open for the youth to use. The Trinity Chapel will become a church on the first floor of the building and office space will be upstairs, including a place for Dana College memorabilia.\\n\\nThe first phase of the project is $4 million. Shada said Angels Share is raising money now.\\n\\nIn future phases and as more people move in, Shada said there will eventually be housing for low-income families and the elderly, along with additional apartments for youth.\\n\\nIt\\'s a project that\\'s been years in the making for Shada.\\n\\n\"It\\'s wonderful to finally have movement after a year of knocking my head against the wall,\" Shada said. \"It\\'s kind of fun to see things moving forward and seeing the people embracing it and see the development starting to occur.\"\\n\\nShada said the first apartments should open to 24 youths in March 2019.\\n\\nAlertMe', 'clickbait': array(['0'], dtype='<U1')}\n",

Mueller III, with a lawyer or lawyers from the law firm of President Trump’s longtime personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz.\\n\\nJudge Kavanaugh appeared somewhat baffled, but he would not offer a blanket “no” because he said he didn’t know the names of every lawyer who worked for the firm, and he had discussed the Mueller investigation with lawyers and judges.\\n\\n“I think you’re thinking of someone, and you don’t want to tell us,” Ms. Harris said without elaboration.\\n\\nSenator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, gave Judge Kavanaugh an opportunity on Thursday to revisit Ms. Harris’s line of questioning. Mr. Kavanaugh responded by acknowledging he doesn’t know everyone who works at the firm, but said, “I don’t recall any conversations of that kind.”\\n\\n“I haven’t had any inappropriate conversations about that investigation with anyone,” Judge Kavanaugh said. “I’ve never given anyone any winks, hints, forecasts, previews, nothing, about my view as a judge, or how I would rule as a judge on that or anything related to that.”\\n\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\n\\nIn a letter last June to Mr. Mueller, Mr. Kasowitz cited a majority opinion by Judge Kavanaugh, without naming him, saying, “The President may decline to prosecute certain violators of federal law just as the President may pardon certain violators of federal law. The President may decline to prosecute or may pardon because of the President’s own constitutional concerns about a law or because of policy objections to the law, among other reasons.”\\n\\nThe question is, can and will the senator tell the public what she knows?\\n\\nCameras in the high court? Not likely.\\n\\nMost Supreme Court nominees express enthusiasm for cameras in the court at their confirmation hearings, only to change their minds after they join the court. Judge Kavanaugh took a different approach, saying only that “I will have an open mind on it.”\\n\\nHe said his current court, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, has recently allowed live audio coverage of its arguments. That development, he said, was a positive one.\\n\\nBut he offered only vague comments on electronic coverage of the Supreme Court. The court generally releases audio recording of arguments at the end of the week and does not allow camera coverage.\\n\\nJudge Kavanaugh made one novel suggestion, offering that the court should consider camera coverage of the sessions in which the justices summarize their opinions from the bench. The court, which currently releases audio of those sessions months later, is unlikely to adopt the idea. The justices may be wary of suggesting to the public that their informal oral summaries, rather than their written opinions, precisely set out the details of decisions.\", 'clickbait': array(['0'], dtype='<U1')}\n",

They said around 4:55 a.m., after Tessier ate breakfast, they discovered him hanging from a bed sheet in his cell, and life-saving measures were unsuccessful.\\n\\nJury selection for the trial had been ongoing since Tuesday and prosecutors reportedly were hoping to get Tessier convicted and sentenced to life in prison without parole.\\n\\nPolice found Wallen’s body buried in a shallow grave in Damascus on Sept. 13, 2017.

Trump has demanded that aides identify the leaker, according to two people familiar with the matter, though it was unclear how they might go about doing so. The two were not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.\\n\\nIn a \"House of Cards\"-style plot twist in an already over-the-top administration, Trump allies and political insiders scrambled to unmask the writer. But the op-ed also brought to light questions that have been whispered in Washington for more than a year: Is Trump truly in charge? And could a divided executive branch pose a danger to the country?\\n\\nFormer CIA Director John Brennan, a fierce Trump critic, called the op-ed \"active insubordination ... born out of loyalty to the country.\"\\n\\n\"This is not sustainable to have an executive branch where individuals are not following the orders of the chief executive,\" Brennan told NBC\\'s \"Today\" show. \"I do think things will get worse before they get better. I don\\'t know how Donald Trump is going to react to this. A wounded lion is a very dangerous animal, and I think Donald Trump is wounded.\"\\n\\nThe anonymous author, claiming to be part of the \"resistance\" to Trump \"working diligently from within\" his administration, said, \"Many Trump appointees have vowed to do what we can to preserve our democratic institutions while thwarting Mr. Trump\\'s more misguided impulses until he is out of office.\"\\n\\n\"It may be cold comfort in this chaotic era, but Americans should know that there are adults in the room,\" the author continued. \"We fully recognize what is happening. And we are trying to do what\\'s right even when Donald Trump won\\'t.\"\\n\\nTrump raged about the piece in the White House, calling around to confidants to vent about the disloyalty of the author and fuming that the so-called Deep State within the federal government had conspired against him, according to a person familiar with the president\\'s views but not authorized to discuss them publicly.\\n\\nThe text of the op-ed was pulled apart for clues: The writer is identified as an \"administration official\"; does that mean a person who works outside the White House? The references to Russia and the late Sen. John McCain — do they suggest someone working in national security? Does the writing style sound like someone who worked at a think tank? In a tweet, the Times used the pronoun \"he\" to refer to the writer; does that rule out all women?\\n\\nThe newspaper later said the tweet referring to \"he\" had been \"drafted by someone who is not aware of the author\\'s identity, including the gender, so the use of \\'he\\' was an error.\"\\n\\nThe Beltway guessing game seeped into the White House, as current and former staffers alike traded calls and texts trying to figure out who could have written the piece, some turning to reporters and asking them for clues. For many in Trump\\'s orbit, it was stunning to realize just how many people could have been the op-ed\\'s author. And some of the most senior members of the Trump administration were forced to deny they were the author of the attack on their boss.\\n\\nHotly debated on Twitter was the author\\'s use of the word \"lodestar,\" which pops up frequently in speeches by Pence. Could the anonymous figure be someone in Pence\\'s orbit? Others argued that the word \"lodestar\" could have been included to throw people off.\\n\\nIn a rare step, Pence\\'s communications director Jarrod Agen tweeted early Thursday that \"The Vice President puts his name on his Op-Eds. The @nytimes should be ashamed and so should the person who wrote the false, illogical, and gutless op-ed. Our office is above such amateur acts.\"\\n\\nPompeo, who was in India, denied writing the anonymous opinion piece, saying, \"It\\'s not mine.\" He accused the media of trying to undermine the Trump administration and said he found that \"incredibly disturbing.\"\\n\\nCoats later issued his own denial; and with three prominent administration members delivering on-the-record denials, the focus could now fall on other senior aides to do the same, with questions raised about those who stay silent.\\n\\nTrump, appearing at an unrelated event Wednesday at the White House, lashed out at the Times for publishing the op-ed.\\n\\n\"They don\\'t like Donald Trump and I don\\'t like them,\" he said of the newspaper. The op-ed pages of the newspaper are managed separately from its news department.\\n\\nEarly Thursday, Trump followed up with a tweet that touted his administration\\'s accomplishments. His other morning tweets — one on North Korea, the other on the economy — seemed to be an effort to change the subject.\\n\\nThe anonymous author wrote in the Times that where Trump has had successes, they have come \"despite — not because of — the president\\'s leadership style, which is impetuous, adversarial, petty and ineffective.\"\\n\\nThe assertions in the column were largely in line with complaints about Trump\\'s behavior that have repeatedly been raised by various administration officials, often speaking on the condition of anonymity. And they were published a day after the release of details from an explosive new book by longtime journalist Bob Woodward that laid bare concerns among the highest echelon of Trump aides about the president\\'s judgment.\\n\\nThe writer of the Times op-ed said Trump aides are aware of the president\\'s faults and \"many of the senior officials in his own administration are working diligently from within to frustrate parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations. I would know. I am one of them.\"\\n\\nThe writer also alleged \"there were early whispers within the cabinet of invoking the 25th Amendment\" because of the \"instability\" witnessed in the president.\\n\\nThe 25th Amendment allows the vice president to take over if the commander in chief is \"unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.\" It requires that the vice president and a majority of the Cabinet back relieving the president.\\n\\n___\\n\\nFollow Miller on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@zekejmiller , Lucey at http://twitter.com/@catherine_lucey and Lemire at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire', 'clickbait': array(['0'], dtype='<U1')}\n",

Wade and its progeny are the settled law of the land.”\\n\\n“I am not sure that all legal scholars refer to Roe as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level,” Kavanaugh responded, “since Court can always overrule its precedent, and three current Justices on the Court would do so.”\\n\\nThe email was leaked to the New York Times Thursday, and was part of the thousands of documents related to Kavanaugh’s records that were turned over to the Senate Judiciary Committee but deemed “committee confidential,” preventing them from being made public or discussed during the public hearings.\\n\\nDuring the second day of his hearing, Kavanaugh was repeatedly questioned by senators on his stance on abortion and whether, if he is appointed a Supreme Court justice, he would vote to overturn Roe v.

In a forceful op-ed in the New York Times, Rosenstein slammed so-called safe injection sites, where people can use heroin and other drugs under medical supervision without threat of law enforcement. Prompted by California’s recent approval of one such site in San Francisco, he said drug users need treatment, not “a taxpayer-sponsored haven to shoot up.” Roughly 100 safe injection sites exist in 66 cities across the world, but the US has yet to open one, despite a relentless overdose epidemic that killed nearly 72,000 Americans last year. The problem has gotten so dire that at least 20 cities, counties, and states have started to talk about opening these sites — despite the threat of a federal crackdown. “Because federal law clearly prohibits injection sites, cities and counties should expect the Department of Justice to meet the opening of any injection site with swift and aggressive action,” Rosenstein wrote, citing the 1986 “crack house statute” banning anyone from “operating a facility for the purpose of manufacturing, distributing, or using any controlled substance.”\\n\\nThe opioid epidemic is driving debates around the country over safe injection sites, where people can use heroin under medical supervision. Follow This is now streaming on Netflix.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt’s a battle that’s pitted the public health community against law enforcement in recent years, echoing similar fights over needle exchanges at the height of the AIDS epidemic. We dug into the controversy in an episode of the Netflix documentary series Follow This, showing viewers how a massive safe injection site in Vancouver has reversed thousands of overdoses over the past 15 years, and meeting the people fighting for — and against — a proposed site in Seattle. Although the issue has made national headlines about big cities like Seattle, San Francisco, Philadelphia, and New York City, similar proposals have popped up all over the country. Here’s a look at where the discussions have happened so far — and the likely battlegrounds for a war against the feds.\\n\\nSafe Injection Site Proposals Ben Kothe / BuzzFeed News These cities and states have introduced proposals for safe injection sites, or are considering them. Five have been approved, but none have opened yet.\\n\\nSEATTLE In January of 2017, Seattle became the first city to declare its intention to open a safe injection site. But since then, the political and economic hurdles of actually doing so have been made clear: The city has now ditched plans to open up a brick-and-mortar facility in favor of a mobile van unit. What’s more, at least a dozen cities and two counties surrounding Seattle have since banned the sites outright. A controversial attempt to ban a site in Seattle gathered nearly 50,000 signatures last year, before being tossed out by the courts for infringing on public health department.\\n\\n\\n\\nBen Kothe / BuzzFeed News Although Seattle has approved a safe injection site, many cities and counties surrounding it have banned such sites.\\n\\nStill, for now, it does look like Seattle’s site will happen, making it the only place in the US where a local government has not only endorsed a site but funded it: Late last year, the city council dedicated $1.3 million from its budget to set it up. “The crack epidemic really ravaged many cities around the country and the response was to jail people — that perpetuated a cycle of poverty,” Seattle councilmember Rob Johnson told BuzzFeed News on Follow This. “We as elected officials have to stand up and own those previous decisions, but we also have to make sure we don’t repeat them.” PHILADELPHIA A year later, in January of 2018, Philly — which city officials say has the worst fatal overdose rate in the nation among large urban areas — became the second place in the US poised to open a safe injection space. “We cannot just watch as our children, our parents, our brothers, and our sisters die of drug overdose,” Thomas Farley, Philadelphia's health commissioner, said in a statement in January. “We have to use every proven tool we can to save their lives until they recover from the grip of addiction.” Unlike Seattle, Philadelphia’s health department said it would not be funding or operating the site, but rather would support any private sector development. Philadelphia is still looking for an operator and funding to do so, and advocates are pushing the city to consider funding it itself. City officials say they’re ready, if necessary, to fight with the Justice Department. “The federal government should focus its enforcement on the pill mills and illegal drug traffickers who supply the poison that is killing our residents. Not on preventing public health officials from acting to keep Philadelphians from dying,” James Garrow, a spokesperson for Philadelphia’s Department of Public Health, said in a statement in response to the DOJ on Tuesday. “Instead of threatening cities and states, they should bring positive solutions to the table that will save lives.”\\n\\nSAN FRANCISCO Safe injection advocates in California were dealt a blow last year when a bill to allow the facilities in eight counties with high overdose fatality rates — including San Francisco and Los Angeles — stalled in the legislature. But after a city task force evaluated the public health evidence and concluded in favor of launching a safe injection program, the city of San Francisco pushed ahead on its own, first saying it would open a site by July 1, then falling back on opening a “model site” at a local church for public viewing in late August. Last week, California’s state legislature passed an amended version of the bill that would throw the weight of state support behind San Francisco’s efforts to open up a space. The state is still waiting for Gov. Jerry Brown to sign it into law.\\n\\nNEW YORK CITY AND ITHACA In May, New York became the fourth city to announce it would move forward with safe injection spaces, as Mayor Bill de Blasio declared his intention to open four sites across the city. A report released in conjunction with his announcement stated that in 2017, overdoses in New York City killed 1,441 people, more than in any year on record — and more than from suicide, homicide, and motor vehicle accidents combined. A week later, Ithaca Mayor Svante Myrick, who has long been an advocate for safe injection spaces, sent a letter to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo requesting approval to open a site in Ithaca as well. Both cities are still waiting for Cuomo and the state health department’s approval, and Cuomo has called it a “complicated issue,” especially with regards to law enforcement. Cuomo’s challenger in the upcoming Democratic primary, actor Cynthia Nixon, has criticized him for not moving more swiftly.\\n\\nVERMONT Like much of New England, Vermont has been hit hard by the opioid crisis, with an estimated 75 overdose deaths in the first six months of 2018. A bill that would have limited criminal liability for anyone operating a safe injection space in the state of Vermont stalled in the legislature in early 2017. The state’s attorney for Chittenden County, Sarah George, later assembled a commission to study the idea and came out strongly in favor of the state legalizing the sites. “I am confident this will save people's lives,” she said. The announcement of the commission’s support prompted the US attorney in Vermont to issue an official response, stating, “[Safe injection facilities] are counterproductive and dangerous as a matter of policy, and they would violate federal law.” Meanwhile, the city of Burlington is slowly moving forward on its own. A resolution passed by the Burlington City Council in July of 2018 directed city officials and community stakeholders to begin logistical discussions about opening a facility.\\n\\nDENVER Attempts at the state level to open up a safe injection space in Denver were squashed earlier this year when a Republican-led legislative panel rejected a bipartisan bill to allow the city to move forward with its plans. But at least two Denver city council members have visited the Vancouver site to observe how it works. And in July, the mayor released a strategic plan to address fatal opioid overdoses in the city that included an initiative to “reduce barriers to a safe use site.”\\n\\nNetflix Booths at the Insite safe injection facility in Vancouver.\\n\\nCity councilmember Albus Brooks told BuzzFeed News that he has been working on public outreach on the issue and that “there is now community support.” He will be introducing legislation in the fall to open up a privately funded facility in Denver.\\n\\n“Denver is ready for a phase one of these safe consumption sites,” Brooks said.\\n\\nMADISON, WISCONSIN According to news reports this summer, public health officials in Madison are currently researching supervised injection sites, and the mayor has stated that he’s looking forward to learning more about the idea.\\n\\nMARYLAND Two bills attempting to authorize safe injection spaces in Maryland — a House bill in 2017 and a Senate bill in 2018 — have failed to pass the legislature.\\n\\nMAINE In Maine, where 354 people died of an opioid overdose in 2017, the state legislature rejected a bill in 2017 that would have allowed for the creation of a state-sanctioned, privately run safe injection space. But advocates in Portland have been granted the ability to form a subcommittee of the Portland Overdose Task Force to discuss the issue. Mayor Ethan Strimling has said that he’s “very deeply” open to exploring the idea of safe injection sites.\\n\\nWASHINGTON, DC Last September, city councilmember David Grosso sent a letter to the director of the district's Department of Health, asking the agency to look into safe injection sites. Mayor Muriel Bowser responded by saying she would send the health director to Canada to observe Vancouver’s site and report back any findings.\\n\\nMASSACHUSETTS In June of last year, the Boston City Council hosted a heated debate about setting up a safe injection site in the city. But in July of this year, the state Senate in Massachusetts rejected a proposal to establish a legal safe injection space, deciding instead to form a commission to research the issue. The vote came shortly after Massachusetts US Attorney Andrew Lelling released a statement saying, “I cannot envision any scenario in which sites that normalize intravenous use of heroin and fentanyl would be off limits to federal law enforcement efforts.” Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker had also publicly stated that he was “kind of a hard sell” on the safe injection issue.\\n\\nMassachusetts governor Charlie Baker had also publicly stated that he was “kind of a hard sell” on the safe injection issue.\\n\\nMISSOURI In February of 2018, the Missouri House introduced a bill to authorize local health departments and community-based organizations to establish safe injection sites. “I think everybody needs support in changing the trajectory of their future,” said state Rep. Karla May of St. Louis, who introduced the bill. The bill was not passed into law.\\n\\nRHODE ISLAND The Rhode Island Medical Society asked Gov. Gina Raimondo to create a working group to look into supervised injection sites as part of a bigger effort to reduce opioid fatalities in the state. The group met with a policy adviser from the governor's office in May. “This is something that we are continuing to look into,” Joseph Wendelken, spokesperson for the Rhode Island Department of Health, told BuzzFeed News. DELAWARE In December of last year, Karyl Rattay, the health director of the state, said at a Health Care Commission meeting that Delaware public officials were in early discussions about the possibility of bringing a safe injection site to the state. As of March 2018, those discussions have remained in preliminary stages, she said, as Delaware watches how other cities and states implement the sites. “I do hope in the interim that we do see some more openness to people thinking about whether [safe injection sites] could be a good strategy for Delaware,” she said. ●\", 'clickbait': array(['0'], dtype='<U1')}\n",

They involve close-up shots of hands quietly and methodically turning an object over, tracing the words on a label, running the pads of fingertips along a candle or a textured pillow. Some of them feature a personal moment between two people, like one woman brushing another woman’s hair, or giving a back massage, or a calming makeup tutorial. Other videos rely on role-play. Vloggers peer into the camera and treat you like a patient in need of some soothing medical care (an ear cleaning, perhaps), or offer advice during a panic attack, or swipe makeup brushes across the camera lens. They talk to you like an old friend. It’s gloriously one-sided, an interaction that requires, at most, a little make-believe, and at least, the experience of being a voyeur.\\n\\nFace-to-face intimacy inevitably means you have to give something back, even if you’re not in a caretaking role. Getting a real massage might mean worrying about how your body looks to another person or gathering courage to tell the person working on you what makes you comfortable or not. Getting help for a panic attack can feel more daunting than the attack itself because it requires a human interaction that you might not be ready to have. Enter Whisperlodge. Part therapeutic experience, part living art installation, this hourlong live ASMR experience aims to “work one-on-one with each guest in a series of visual, auditory, and haptic treatments designed to relax the body and mind.” The sessions, which have taken place in New York and San Francisco, usually cost $90. (Alternatively, you can request an On Demand session with one of their co-creators, which is a live, customized session for just $70 for a half hour.) “What we are doing here,” says cofounder Melinda Lauw, “is in a way trying to combat how everything is being digitized in our lives. By bringing this to a live setting, we are forcing you to try to have this intimate connection with someone.”\\n\\nNetflix Melinda Lauw, Whisperlodge co-creator, and Chia Lynn Kwa, design director and production manager, make soothing brushing sounds.\\n\\nI went to a Whisperlodge spa experience in a rented Brooklyn apartment earlier this year, along with three other people looking for an IRL ASMR experience. Two of the other three attendees had been to a Whisperlodge session before, and treated the experience with a religious kind of reverence, quietly awed with their heads bowed as we signed our consent forms agreeing to be touched (within reason). Once inside, a tiny woman, dressed head to toe in white, approached me to ask if she could blindfold me. It was the first of many questions in Whisperlodge that were necessary but had an eerie edge all the same. “I guess you can blindfold me, but this is a weird question to ask and it’s not exactly something I’m looking forward to” is probably not the ideal response. She smiled and covered my eyes with a white strip of silky fabric before whispering gibberish in each ear. They were a scattering of words that didn’t make any sense together but sounded nice when sliding directly into your ear. The only word I think I recall clearly is “carburetor.”\\n\\nA predictable and poorly plotted horror movie would start out like this.\\n\\nAfterward, she guided me down a narrow entrance, holding my hands in hers as she led me through a door and up a winding staircase, before taking me into another room and gently closing the door. Blindfolded, I felt like I could die at any moment. I gently panicked as she led me to a chair where I was surrounded by people making inscrutable sounds right next to my ears. They sounded, respectively, like a tennis racket being plucked, a CVS receipt being crinkled, and a broom whooshing around our feet. (The broom brushed up against my feet and I worried, for a moment, that it was a very large rat king.) Look, there’s no denying this is how you get murdered. Suggesting to yourself, or anyone for that matter, “Hey, I’m going to go to this apartment in a city I don’t live in, blindfolded and confused, so that I can pay a couple of strangers to touch me and hopefully I’ll be into it, but generally speaking, my safety is entirely in their hands” is not usually a good idea. A predictable and poorly plotted horror movie would start out like this and it would end with my wearing a white robe (which they actually did have us wear) and joining a cult through human sacrifice. Finally removing our blindfolds didn’t assuage my anxiety either. A swell of faux-spiritual music played in the all-white apartment, the only color coming from a glow of pinkish light shining from behind a white sheet, as the woman who blindfolded me sat on her knees facing us. She pulled her shirt down to reveal her back. Two more Whisperlodge facilitators dressed in white approached her with plush makeup brushes, drawing on her back in a choreographed dance. It was wildly precious, like a grad school art installation, except not only was the “art” inscrutable, but everyone around me was having a near-psychedelic reaction to it, leaving me completely alienated. I watched as one of my fellow attendees began showing signs of the ASMR tingle — dead eyes, relaxed jaw, a look of mild euphoria — and was overcome with jealousy.\\n\\nNetflix Pamela Martinez performs an intimate face brushing ritual in the red room.\\n\\nAfter our communal triggering session, we had our choice of three rooms where we would be cared for alone. The first was set up to simulate a doctor’s office. This role-play is common in ASMR videos, from cranial nerve exams to naturopaths to gynecologists (NO). The doctor isn’t exactly a calming environment, but maybe the idea around simulating the experience is to subvert whatever anxiety you might have about going by watching a video that shows the doctor as gentle and loving. To start, I was led into the medical room. My “doctor” at Whisperlodge was a slight, smiling woman who sat me down in the corner of a room dimly lit in blue. She put her hands close to my face and showed me how she put on her blue latex gloves, remarking that they fit her hands so perfectly, rubbing her fingers together and making my brain feel like it was getting a hot shower. “Today,” she said, “we’re just going to do a small sensory checkup.” With Q-tip in hand, she asked me to close my eyes and create a “mental map” of my own ear, which she traced with remarkable care. Almost immediately, my brain let off little fireworks, a feeling I know all too well from watching a video of this exact process. It’s here that I finally gave in and let someone take care of me. I sank deeper into relaxation when she asked me to lie down on a bed, still warm in my white robe. Using an eyedropper, she dripped water onto my fingertips, my wrists, my forehead, my throat, an act so tender that I forgot momentarily that this woman was a stranger. But who cares! In that moment, I was a paragon of serenity as her steady voice invented medical problems that she was in the process of fixing. I was zen. I was in a state of meditation and understood why people are always talking about flax seeds and face masks.\\n\\nWhile the first room was all cool tones, calming vibes, a peaceful blue ocean, the second room I was brought into, awash in a dim red light, had more of a sex dungeon vibe, led by someone who was so aggressively coquettish, I was wholly convinced she was actually a virgin. “The character in that scene is more flirtatious,” Lauw said. “If it arouses someone, then that works for that person, and I don’t think that we should say that that is wrong.” Dressed in a lacy white dress, the woman playing host was buxom and beautiful as she walked around with a paper fan, peeking out at me from the top of it. She held out a tray with a variety of makeup brushes for my choosing, then brushed my hand and face while reminding me over and over again that the brush was my choice. I picked it. I did this.\\n\\nMy idea of relaxation doesn’t include telling someone about the mundane or profound desires in my life.\\n\\nShe seemed to be an intentional representation of the sexiness and intimacy that can come with ASMR, namely when hosted by a woman who is actively flirting with you. Some ASMR YouTubers do this already — ASMaRgaritte’s videos focus on her cleavage while she whispers to you, others do “girlfriend experience” ASMR, others still make videos promising a “hands-free orgasm.” (This, I think, reminds me a little of that passage in the latest Jonathan Safran Foer book, where the protagonist gives his wife an orgasm merely by looking at her vagina. My reaction is the same: You fuckin’ wish, buddy.) Perhaps the glowing red room’s scenario appeals to some, but my heart rate increased not because I was having an asexual awakening but because my host kept asking me questions I didn’t have the answers to — like what I wanted in life — while spraying a half gallon of rose water on my face. I was both confused and sticky. I’m also tragically prone to secondhand embarrassment: Every time she fanned herself and looked at me with bedroom eyes, I wanted to take her hand and say, No, good god, please stop, this is like watching the UK version of The Office in real time, I don’t have any cringe left in my body for you. Worse, though, was that she kept wanting me to talk about my feelings. What I desired. I wanted to go home and call a Chinese restaurant with an order for enough spring rolls to feed six people and then eat them myself, alone, while watching RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars. But I didn’t tell her that. “What are your desires?” my host asked me again. My idea of relaxation doesn’t include telling someone about the mundane or profound desires in my life, which include but are not limited to: squeezing out an ingrown hair, falling asleep in the middle of a meal and waking up to finish said meal, and, of course, getting out of this room.\\n\\nNetflix Martinez in the red room at Whisperlodge.\\n\\nThe first few experiences, though not exactly a spa treatment, do lend themselves inherently to some semblance of relaxation. Being tended to by a kind woman is calming. A caring doctor can create a real sense of much-needed intimacy in someone’s life. Sensory deprivation through blindfolding is a good way to heighten your other senses. But despite my affection for ASMR, I can’t see anything soothing about a male teacher. All my male teachers have either been lecherous, or assholes, or mouthbreathers with coffee breath. Andrew Hoepfner, one of the cofounders of Whisperlodge who acted as the pseudo teacher for one of my last experiences, was certainly none of those things, but I hated him instinctively, the way I hate all orange-flavored candies. This wasn’t his fault, but I couldn’t figure out who would enjoy the intimacy of this particular room, set up to make you a student, and him an educator.\\n\\nHoepfner switched from ear to ear, whispering a brief explanation of ASMR to me. A small leather bag was on the table in front of me, bearing different kinds of, frankly, garbage. There was bubble wrap, tissue paper, crepe paper, and I was told to pick one so that he could play with them next to my head while telling me about how he used to be a terrible student. I hated this. Again, this wasn’t Hoepfner’s fault — much like the Sexy Lady in the red room, he was playing a role intended to give pleasure, but instead, I was resentful of having to play along. I felt like he was mansplaining ASMR to me as he balled up interstitials of crepe paper. After our personal sessions, we were brought to our final room for a live ASMR show as a group. We sat in a semicircle and were given headphones attached to a binaural microphone with two silicone ears on either side, the very same used by some of the most popular ASMR YouTubers. I waited for one of the organizers to approach the microphone with whispering or tapping or maybe some of the mouth sounds a lot of people online like so much. Instead, a mound of fabric on the floor in front of the mic that I thought was covering a pillow began to rise, and I was sure that, now, this was the time when I was going to be murdered. Instead, it was Lauw, one of the cofounders, rising from chiffon, ready to recreate the sounds you might hear as you get ready for your day: washing your face, brushing your teeth, changing your clothes, snipping a few flowers in your backyard (and handing one to me, of course). And it was soothing, somehow — I felt like when I was a kid and I’d watch my older cousins rhythmically sweep mascara onto their eyes. Boring, yes, but in this age, monotony can be incredibly comforting.\\n\\nThe flaw of Whisperlodge is clear: Participation is bullshit. Sometimes getting involved with your own self-care is exhausting. When you’re anxious or depressed, seeing a therapist or your friends or just so much as leaving your house can feel too daunting to broach. Similarly, spending $90 on a ticket and dragging yourself out to some haunted mansion to be blindfolded and prodded by a stranger is its own kind of stress, one that might outweigh whatever relaxation you could possibly get from it. The internet has changed how we live — I think almost entirely in memes at this point — so of course it would change how much or how little we’re willing to give in a social interaction. But Whisperlodge forces you to play along, which is exactly why it can’t really translate into a pleasurable IRL experience. It’s human nature to worry about how you come off to other people, what they think of you, whether you seem foolish or needy or weird to a new person. Online, ASMR works because you can turn your brain off and not worry about any of that other stuff; Whisperlodge takes the tenets of online intimacy — while also dragging along with it all the unpleasant parts of human interaction, like eye contact and small talk — and lets people get oddly close to your face. Real intimacy requires a kind of leap of faith, one where you either participate in your own comfort or you sacrifice a piece of it, eventually, in one form or another. Whisperlodge seems too risky, too intimate an experience to share even with someone willing to do the face brushing and sensory checkups. We’re forced into the push and pull of social interactions every day — so maybe it’s just nice to have this one small thing, online, all to ourselves. ●', 'clickbait': array(['1'], dtype='<U1')}\n",

I’d arranged to chat with him about the future of disinformation expecting a sober prediction of the coming years as incrementally worse. But Ovadya painted a far bleaker picture — a future in which an array of easy-to-use and seamless technology would democratize the ability to manipulate perception and falsify reality. What happens, he mused, “when anyone can make it appear as if anything has happened, regardless of whether or not it did?\" Ovadya told me about \"reality apathy,\" \"human puppets,\" and \"the Infocalypse.\" It was terrifying — more so because early versions of some of the dystopian technology we discussed is already here; some of it is even available to the public.\\n\\nWhich is how I ended up creating an AI-rendered digital recreation of my voice that was so convincing it fooled the person who arguably knows my voice better than anyone: my mom.\\n\\nFor more on this story, watch the new BuzzFeed News series Follow This on Netflix. To do it, I used Lyrebird, a free software for creating \"vocal avatars.\" Lyrebird analyzes the cadence of your speech and the way you pronounce vowels and consonants to create a realistic digital copy of your speech patterns. The process requires you to read an assortment of mundane phrases like “watching the parody was great entertainment” or “Eric took his vitamins and continued his exercise regime” while your voice is recorded.\\n\\nLyrebird One of the phrases Lyrebird asks you to read to create the copy of your digital voice.\\n\\nOnce you’ve input enough examples, Lyrebird’s AI creates a copy of your digital voice.

She is intimately familiar with my voice — a difficult target. To prepare, I typed out a bunch of phrases I was likely to use in a short call.

Slack\\n\\nNot only did my Lyrebird voice fool my mom, she had a hard time believing it was created by AI. \"I didn\\'t know something like that was possible,\" she told me later on, reminding me that audio and video manipulation to her sounds more like science fiction than reality. \"I never doubted for a second that it was you.\"\\n\\nLyrebird\\'s technology is far from perfect, but it\\'s evolving fast enough that it doesn\\'t really matter. It\\'s going to get better and it\\'s already good enough to fool my mom.

By contrast, we are making the technology available to anyone and we are introducing it incrementally so that society can adapt to it, leverage its positive aspects for good, while preventing potentially negative applications.\" But Lyrebird is far from the only company playing in the precarious realm of audio and video manipulation. To understand the terrifying future of fake news, I embarked on a reporting quest that led me deep into the world of human puppets, AI, deepfakes, and digital harassment. ●', 'clickbait': array(['1'], dtype='<U1')}\n",

The new parents decided to name the child Jonas. The next day, the senior physician called Nicole S.’s husband with a correction. “Actually,” the physician said, “the child is more of a girl.” Doctors visiting Nicole S.’s room recommended cosmetic surgery. “They said it’s nothing to worry about, nobody will see it ever again,” Nicole S. told BuzzFeed News. At this point, she and her husband were worried about their child and left feeling alone, Nicole S. recalled. And they were up against a deadline: Their newborn’s gender needed to be reported to the registrar’s office.\\n\\nFor more on this story, watch the new BuzzFeed News show Follow This on Netflix.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“There was so little information. What’s the right thing to do here?” asked Nicole S., in a recent interview with BuzzFeed News. “I have the impression that there are no well-trained personnel for these instances,” her husband said. Nicole S.’s intersex child is 11 years old now. Melina, who was born with a penis and a vagina, says “I am both,” when speaking with her parents and siblings. Shortly after she was born, doctors diagnosed her with “true hermaphroditism,” which in the US is a medical term that’s no longer regularly in use. Nicole S. and Melina are pseudonyms, as the mother wishes to remain anonymous, to protect her daughter from the public. “The subject is taboo, even today,” Nicole S. said. (Despite multiple telephone and email requests to various associations and people who have dealt with the issue, only the S. family has been willing to speak with BuzzFeed News.) Around one in every 2,000 children is born intersex, according to the National Institutes of Health, the largest health authority in the US. Another estimate places the figure much higher, at up to 1.7% worldwide. It’s hard to pin down a number because intersexuality, like color, is a spectrum: It depends on which biological markers are used to determine where one sex ends and the other begins.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The subject is taboo, even today.”\\n\\nPeople are classified as intersex if they are neither clearly male nor female. This may be because they were born with both a penis and a vagina, or because their body doesn’t recognize certain sex hormones. For decades, doctors have often reacted with largely uncontrolled and controversial operations, and hormone treatments in order to make infants’ genitals and sex organs “more normal.” It’s a practice that continues partly to this day in Germany. Attorneys, with focuses as diverse as human rights and science, consider these surgeries to be (at times grievous) bodily harm. But there are virtually never any legal consequences for the doctors who perform them. The largest interest group for intersex individuals in Germany, Intersexuelle Menschen e.V., offers free consultations to affected families around the country, but these services are rarely used. Many doctors and midwives are unaware of the most recent medical guidelines on the matter. As a result dozens, or even hundreds, of genital operations are performed on intersex children every year — some of which, according to research conducted by BuzzFeed News, are clear violations of German medical guidelines. And there is barely any political interest in the topic, in Germany or abroad. BuzzFeed News has spoken with doctors, professional associations, affected individuals, and attorneys. While the medical world wants to cure people with differences of sex development, also known as DSD and formerly called disorders of sex development, people who are diagnosed with such often do not see their condition as a disease. And in current medical practice, there is an intermingling of social and medical ideas about what a “healthy” sex actually is.\\n\\nWhen Melina was first born, the hospital’s chief physician advised Nicole S. and her husband to raise the child as a girl, but to postpone an operation. She gave them the address of an intersex self-help group. The parents read up online and made an appointment at a special clinic in Lübeck, northern Germany, meeting with renowned physician Olaf Hiort, who runs the hormone center there and specializes in intersex patients. There, the doctors performed an ultrasound where they learned Melina had an ovary on one side, a testicle on the other, and a womb. But also, more importantly, she was healthy. The parents opted to raise the child as a girl, only openly speaking with their close friends and family members about Melina’s intersexuality.\\n\\n“Unfortunately our society is still so binary-driven.”\\n\\nYet Nicole S. is now uncertain whether they made the right choice. “I don’t know if it’s good that Melina’s gender role is so defined now, even though she can change it whenever she wants.” She wishes she had more time after giving birth to have made a decision. “At the time I didn’t think it was right to raise our daughter entirely intersex and to tell everyone about it. I was just afraid of her being ostracized.” When Nicole S. eventually told Melina’s kindergarten teacher and later the principal about her daughter’s intersexuality, neither of them had ever heard of it. “Unfortunately our society is still so binary-driven,” Nicole S. said. “Only over time do you learn that it’s not just black and white,” her husband agreed. The list of resulting complications is long for parents who opted for a surgery: pain, decreased sexual enjoyment and sensation, infertility, lifelong hormone therapy, inflammation, depression, risk of suicide, shattered family relationships. And there are many cases of intersexual adults who, as children, were surgically “turned into” a boy or girl but who now feel as though their gender identity doesn’t align with the bodies they were surgically given.\\n\\n\\n\\nNetflix\\n\\nOne person who wishes they had never had the surgery as a child is Maxi Bauermeister, who was born at a time when Germany was still divided into two separate states. “In my opinion, I was forcibly castrated,” Maxi said in an interview with BuzzFeed News. When Maxi’s mother, Christiane, was in the advanced stages of her pregnancy, she went in for an ultrasound, thinking she was going to have a boy. “The penis isn’t presenting,” the doctor told her. Christiane did not think anything of it at the time, thinking the penis would develop. On the third day following the birth, the doctors came to her bedside and said, “We cannot determine the sex of the child. It doesn’t have a penis. It would be best if you raise the child as a girl.” “I was incredibly shocked and thought, I can’t just turn a boy into a girl; I’m not God almighty, after all,” Christiane told BuzzFeed News. She discussed the issue with the child’s father — felt disconcerted and helpless. It was 1984, and the word “intersex” was unheard of. There was no information on the subject except for the doctors’ advice: “Turn the child into a girl.” The parents at first decided against a surgery; the child’s sex wasn’t immediately recorded on their birth certificate. When Christiane traveled to visit her family in south Germany, she smuggled the child onto the airplane in a bag because they did not have a passport. Christiane went to various specialists, all of whom told her the same thing: Only as a girl will the child be able to lead a happy life. When Maxi turned 2, Christiane agreed to an operation where the child’s testicles were removed from the abdomen. The child was sterilized for life as a result, Christiane told BuzzFeed News. (Although there are no medical records to prove Maxi would have been fertile, there are many cases where intersex children have the potential for fertility.) A hole was then surgically created to act as an artificial vagina.\\n\\nNetflix Maxi Bauermeister on their farm in Brandenburg, Germany.\\n\\nAs late as recent decades, intersex children’s vaginas were regularly penetrated with a “bougie,” an instrument used to ensure that the artificially created hole would not close again. The children’s so-called neo-vaginas were regularly expanded with candle-shaped metal rods of various sizes. There’s no evidence the highly criticized practice is still used today; when Maxi was born, they were spared.\\n\\nMuch has changed since then. Malta banned “normalizing” surgeries on intersex children in 2015, making it the first and still only country worldwide to mandate this by law. Several new medical guidelines were published in recent years, including in 2006 and specifically in Germany in 2016. “No medical or psychological intervention will alter the state of ambiguity, per se,” reads the current German guideline from 2016. Operations must now be less invasive and more infrequent. And then, on Tuesday, Aug. 28, the California State Legislature passed a resolution denouncing “corrective” surgeries on intersex children. “We are uncertain if, and to what extent, the guidelines published by the scientific medical societies in 2016 are adhered to,” wrote the German Medical Association in an email to BuzzFeed News. The guidelines are not legally binding, and there’s no oversight mechanism to determine whether they are read by doctors or medical personnel, such as midwives.\\n\\nNetflix Humboldt University of Berlin.\\n\\nA study by Humboldt University of Berlin shows that around 1,700 genital operations are still performed on intersex children every year. The number of operations on children diagnosed as intersex has barely decreased since 2005. “It’s incomprehensible to me that society and the government are standing idly by while genital mutilations are being performed on intersex children in Germany day after day,” Lucie Veith, one of the most well-known intersex activists in Germany and a member of the association Intersexuelle Menschen e.V., said during a phone interview. Susanne Krege, director of the Urological Clinic in Essen, has a different view. “The ... accusation that we perform mutilations, I wouldn’t put it like that. It certainly was that way 20, 30 years ago, but nowadays we actually work with micro-instruments and magnifying spectacles, allowing us to perform very good reconstructive surgeries to male and female,” Krege told BuzzFeed News over the phone. Doctors and activists have yet to agree on the question of when surgery is necessary for intersex children, given different understandings of where intersexuality begins.\\n\\nDoctors and activists have yet to agree on the question of when surgery is necessary for intersex children.\\n\\n\\n\\nDoctors frequently argue that corrections are necessary if a child will clearly develop into a boy or girl, yet the sex organs deviate from the norm or in terms of function. For example, when the hole of a penis does not end at the tip, but instead somewhere else, as is the case in about 1 in 300 newborn boys. Or when a girl’s clitoris is unusually large, which is sometimes associated with medical complications of the urethra. They’re joined by a parent and patient initiative in Germany — called the CAH Parents and Patients Initiative — that advocates on behalf of people with a particularly common diagnosis called congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). The initiative considers early genital surgery to be the correct course of action and a necessity, rather than cosmetic. The young women in the group meetings “are very satisfied with the results of operations,” the initiative wrote in a statement in the 2016 guidelines. “These are cases of genital cutting. In the event of an enlarged clitoris, if doctors and parents claim that the child is a girl, then a girl is having her genitals mutilated,” says activist Veith. An inquiry from BuzzFeed News to Germany’s Federal Statistical Office shows that between 2010 and 2016, at least 55 children under the age of 9 underwent clitoris surgery — even though they had been diagnosed as intersex. Another request from BuzzFeed News shows that between 2005 and 2016, more than 11,000 surgical interventions on intersex children took place. Among them were more than 500 plastic reconstructions of the penis — a particularly drastic intervention — although the guidelines since 2005 have called for caution. In 2015, the German Medical Association wrote in a statement: “In newborns and infants, no effective consent to an intervention is possible.” Concerned minors have the “right to an open future,” the statement said, adding that there should be no “irreversible surgical procedures” unless it is medically necessary. And in the same year, the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights concluded that intersex individuals in the EU are being denied their human rights. Given the pressure to adhere to the new standards, many doctors have begun avoiding the press when it comes to intersex issues — some because they do not follow the guidelines and fear punishment, while others are wary of wading publicly into such a controversial topic. Hiort, who also chairs the international intersex doctor network DSDnet, was not willing to speak with BuzzFeed News, despite multiple written and telephone requests over the span of months. A spokesperson for the hospital where Hiort works who spoke to BuzzFeed News over the phone earlier this year says that Hiort has to protect the physicians in the network from the public, and that there have been bad experiences in the past. Another doctor reached by BuzzFeed News, who is herself intersex and who has published multiple articles on the topic, wished neither to speak about nor be quoted on the matter. Krege is one of the few who does. “We always just argue that the child is being harmed when they are operated on so early. But if we leave the child with an inconsistent sex, there are no studies of whether this doesn’t also cause harm,” says Krege. In fact, there are hardly any studies of how intersex children develop without hormonal or surgical treatment. But research from 2014 shows that intersex children who grow up nonbinary in terms of their gender identity are not automatically discriminated against.\\n\\nPeter Steffen / AFP / Getty Images Intersex person Vanja, seen in this 2014 file photo, is registered as female, but a chromosome analysis found them to be neither male nor female. They brought an appeal on civil status with Germany to legally recognize a “third gender” from birth.\\n\\nIf and when these operations should be performed is not the only point of contention — another matter is who is allowed to decide. “I find it questionable for parents to be able to represent their children in these cases,” says attorney Konstanze Plett, who has been working on this topic for decades. Whenever an operation is later believed to have been incorrect or botched, there are almost never legal proceedings against doctors or hospitals. This is because there are questions surrounding who would file the suit, since the parents themselves consented to the operation. It would be difficult for them to be able to prove after the fact that they were not sufficiently informed. During criminal proceedings, the medical norms at the time of the operation as well as the respective prevalent social values and mores are taken into consideration. Also, if the children are old enough to be able to take hospitals and doctors to court, the statute of limitations has often lapsed or the files are no longer in the archives.\\n\\n“What use are the best laws if the people that they’re supposed to protect can’t use them?”\\n\\nAt a November 2017 symposium in Berlin, medical historian Anette Grünewald said that there are frequently surgeries that are not medically necessary in children under 2 years old. “Those fall into the range of the enhancement surgery and are thereby cosmetic operations,” Grünewald said, adding that these surgeries are punishable according to the current legal situation, but the laws are not enforced. “There are cases of bodily harm or grievous bodily harm,” Plett told BuzzFeed News, referring to clitoris reductions or cases like Maxi Bauermeister, where the testes were removed and the child was made infertile. “That would not only be an offense, but a crime — like female genital mutilation, according to a new law from 2013.” “Awareness among doctors that you shouldn’t do that has really increased in recent years,” Dr. Krege of the Clinic of Urology in Essen told BuzzFeed News. “But it’s uncertain whether this awareness will actually reach the most rural areas. ... And then, of course, there are those colleagues who simply don’t want to accept that things aren’t done the way they once were. They don’t want to believe these arguments.” She declined to name anybody specifically. Nicole S., the mother with the 11-year-old child, confirms this from her own experiences in self-help groups. She estimates that half of the children from the groups were operated on without there having been any medical necessity to do so.\\n\\nFackelträger Verlag Gmbh Christiane Völling\\n\\nIn 2009, Christiane Völling became the first and only intersex person to successfully sue a doctor in Germany, when she was awarded damages of 100,000 euros (around $117,000 under today’s exchange rate). In 1997, when she was 18 years old, Völling was forced to undergo an operation without her consent or any explanation, in which her uterus and ovaries were removed. “That was a special case,” Plett said. “What use are the best laws if the people that they’re supposed to protect can’t use them?” Every family in Germany with an intersex child is supposed to receive independent consultation before an operation, according to the guidelines from 2016. Yet there is only one provider of such consultations: Intersexuelle Menschen e.V. and its mere 33 volunteer advisers. The association estimates that the free, nationwide consultation only reaches 15% of families with intersex children who undergo surgery, leaving the vast majority of them exclusively advised by doctors. This, they say, is insufficient. “We have never been approached by a hospital in Hamburg for peer consultation,” Ursula Rosen, an adviser with Intersexuelle Menschen e.V., said during an expert hearing in the Senate of Hamburg in June 2018. This is remarkable because, between 2010 and 2015, multiple operations were performed in Hamburg on children who had been diagnosed as intersex. This is according to a large-scale inquiry of the Senate of Hamburg from July 2017. “Not every hospital even knows about our association. And we weren’t taken seriously for a long time,” Rosen told BuzzFeed News. There has been some movement on the issue politically inside Germany in recent years. Since 2013, it has been possible in Germany to omit one’s sex from a passport entirely. Maxi Bauermeister’s passport now bears an “X” in place of the “F” for “female” that was once there. But in 2017 the country’s Federal Constitutional Court declared that this is not sufficient. The court says that according to Germany’s General Personality Right (or the right to protection of one’s personal information and affairs), intersex persons have the right to a positive designation. For the first time in Germany, there will thus be a specific term for intersex individuals’ passports and birth certificates by the end of this year. That term will most likely be “Diverse.” Germany would be the first country in the European Union to take such a step.\\n\\nNetflix Federal Minister of Justice Katarina Barley\\n\\nFederal Minister of Justice Katarina Barley has announced multiple times her desire to ban operations on intersex children. As of yet there is no draft proposal for such a law. “Quite a lot of people do not know what intersex is, even in this political landscape,” said Barley in an interview with BuzzFeed News. This was not necessarily ill will, she said, but often simple ignorance. “How to deal with minority issues that do not personally concern you, however, shows how strong a constitutional state and a democracy is,” said Barley. “If everyone thinks only of themselves, we become a society of egoists in which I do not want to live.” “I wish I could just say, ‘this is my child, they are intersex, and they get to choose whether they want to play sports with the boys or the girls.’ That would be my dream,” Nicole S. said. A few years ago, Melina told a friend she was playing with that she is intersex. The girls had taken their clothes off and the friend asked why Melina looked so different. After all, girls don’t have a penis. Melina’s father said, “Actually, some of them do.” That’s not true, said the friend, she read so in the newspaper. “But you can see for yourself, right in front of you,” answered Melina’s father. The friend took a look, and later asked her parents, “Can people buy that?” She wanted one, too. ●', 'clickbait': array(['1'], dtype='<U1')}\n",

Here are some of their responses!\\n\\n1. This person who just wanted to stay fit: I was living in the US at the time. Once, in an elevator on my way home from the gym, an elderly couple started talking about my clothes in Finnish. They said how kids nowadays don\\'t know what to wear and wondered how I could possibly be in public looking the way I was. I turned to them in my glorious, sweaty state and told them in Finnish with a smile on my face that I thought they looked lovely as well. They both went red in the face and were silent until we got out. I just laughed. —annika1996penttila\\n\\n2. These guy who dug himself a deep hole: Although I don’t look very Russian, I’ve spoken it since birth with my mom and grandma. I used to work at a grocery store, and a couple of Russian teenagers are checking out at my register. I kid you not, one of the first things one of them says is, “This bitch had no idea I stole the chocolate.” First of all RUDE and second of all, what self respecting teenager would think stealing raspberry-chocolate would impress their friends?! I was like, “I didn’t until you just told me” and it looked like he shit his pants. —259525\\n\\n3. This person who should think before they speak: A few years ago, my family and our friends all vacationed in Berlin. My friend and I are both fluent in Russian and English, but we primarily speak English. One day, while we were at a museum, we got bored and decided to go up and down the glass elevator. We kept giggling, making jokes, and it was a great time until some woman with her family got in. She quickly chose her floor and remarked to her family (in Russian) that we were acting stupid and were ugly. As she got out of the elevator, my friend and I yelled out (also in Russian) \"Have a nice day!\" and the look on her face is one I will never forget. —sleepingoctopi\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n4. This very mature comeback: OK so my parents are both Indian and I look very Indian. There\\'s no indication from my appearance that I would speak French AT ALL. So I got into a lift at my apartment complex and these two men walked into the escalators, speaking in French about VERY RACIST stuff. So when the lift got to their floor, I held the lift door open and gave them a piece of my mind, ending with a polite and charming “bonne journée!” before closing the door of the lift. They literally had their jaws drop to the floor. They were so uncomfortable and I felt very proud of myself that day! —manasvinib\\n\\n5. This annoyed retail worker: I work in retail and live in an area with a high density of Filipinos. I was born and raised in the US, but understand and speak the language. Two Filipino ladies came in and started looking around. I greeted them and asked where they were from. Then they asked me where I was from because I look Filipino. But because I’m born in the US, I don’t have the accent. So when I said I was from the US, they said to each other that I was dumb for not knowing the language, that my parents are stupid for not teaching me, and that kids like me make the country look bad. Then they asked me for a product in a size that we didn’t have. When I went to start her transaction, she started getting angry about how everything was so expensive, that I’m stupid, and how I obviously don’t know what I’m doing. So after I finished her transaction, I told her to have a good day in our language and she looked at her friend, then back at me, and walked away. Her face when I spoke the language to her was definitely worth it. —123adrienne\\n\\n6. This awkward nail salon experience: One time, I went to this Vietnamese nail salon and had a pedicure. I walked in and said that I\\'d like to have a pedicure please. They didn\\'t expect a thing and thought I\\'m just another mixed Asian kid who doesn\\'t know Vietnamese. The lady that I had was like, \"Yeah I\\'m good, will do\". Right away, she started to gossip with the lady next to her about how I have a beard and ugly-ass toes. I immediately told her that I know Vietnamese, in Vietnamese, and the look on her face was hilarious. —t44aa36efc\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n7. This satisfying plot twist: I speak English and Italian fluently so I don’t get many of these experiences living in the US, but it happened one time, when I was at JFK airport in the check-in line on my way to Rome to visit my family. I had standby tickets because my uncle is a flight attendant. I got to the front of the line and a lady calls us to her and while we’re taking out our passports. Soon after, she was saying things like “Why do these stupid people always come to me.” and “Ugh, this bitch can’t even dress. What’s the matter with her husband? What a dumbass.” in Italian. Her supervisor didn’t even respond, probably because he knows better than to do that. So while she kept talking shit about us, I got a call from my mom, who I only speak Italian to. I smiled and talked in Italian (nice and loud for the lady to hear), “Hi mom! Yeah we’re getting our tickets right now. Tell Nonna I said hi and we’ll see her in the morning. Ok, bye!” I look up at the lady and her eyes were wide open and her mouth just dropped. I don’t think I’ve ever seen someone so mortified. Her supervisor looked so pissed off at her. He took our tickets and said “Oh cazzo!”, which means \"oh shit!”. He then said, “Stefania! That’s Diego’s niece.” To which she looked even worse because my uncle worked for the company for YEARS and is well known and liked. —saraf46cbcaf4c\\n\\n8. This situation with nosey diners: Since I grew up in America, no one thought I spoke Kannada. Once in India, my grandparents took me and my brother out to eat. We cannot drink tap water so we kept having to order bottled water. I guess the table nearby heard my grandma explain that we were foreign and the woman sitting there said, \"What do you think? Are they spoiled brats or too weak to handle the spice?\" As I walked out, I made sure to ask my Grandma something in Kannada and glare at the woman. —melonette000\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n9. This failed assumption: While I was born and raised in Malaysia, I prefer speaking English with some of my friends because it\\'s a habit my family instilled into me at a young age. I went on a short vacation in a small state area. I was on the phone with my friend and was waiting in line at a food stall when two young women behind me said some stuff in my mother tongue out loud. \"Do you think she can speak our language? She\\'s gonna\\' take longer time to order because she doesn\\'t even know what they sell here. These tourists are so annoying!\" she said. After getting off the phone, I purposely ordered in Bahasa Malaysia, loud and clear for those women in the back, complete in the state\\'s dialect as well. Needless to say, those women stood as far as possible from me afterwards. —heraf\\n\\n10. This priceless interaction at the zoo: I was at the zoo with my son when I was 39 weeks pregnant with my second son. Two Spanish speaking teenage girls made fun of how slow I was and said that I walked like a cow. The look on their faces was priceless when they heard me speak to my son in Spanish. I really enjoyed their embarrassment and was sure to flash them the bitchiest smile I could muster. —tenfoldsnails\\n\\n11. This awkward wait for the flight: I speak Norwegian, which means I can pretty much understand Swedish and Danish. I had been sitting at the Denver airport waiting for my flight to London when a group of about ten Danes started sitting around me. I had already been sitting there for a good two hours and by the time this family came around, the seats at the gate were all taken. A few of the family members got seats and a few had to sit on the floor. They started making nasty comments about all the people around them and in general calling Americans fat and stupid. It wasn\\'t long before their comments were pointed in my direction. They were complaining that I was such a bitch because I had not gotten up to let them sit together. I was at the end of a row so it\\'s not like they had to sit on either side of me. Then they started saying that I was only pretending to read the book because \"Americans are too stupid to read.\" The funny thing was, I was reading a Norwegian book. So when I heard this, I adjusted my book so they could see the title. Once they realized I probably understood them, they started trying to pretend they were talking about someone else. I got to board before them, so when I stood up I told them in Norwegian they can have my seat now. They all seemed extremely embarrassed. —kristinb456001448\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n12. This person who shut down a whole group of people: I was in France with on an exchange trip. At school, my partner’s friends were calling me the “dumb American” and saying how I “probably didn’t even know what they were saying\", and making fun of my small size. I laughed along, but just quietly added that I could understand them. The look on their faces was priceless. They didn’t make fun of me anymore. —ptoe\\n\\n13. This ultimate win: A few years ago, I was backpacking through Peru with a few friends. From the moment we arrived, we realised that everybody assumed we were American (we are Belgian) and that we did not speak any Spanish (all of us did). So we decided to use those assumptions to our advantage when negotiating on prices and such. About a week in, we were trying to arrange a hiking trip to the Colca Canyon. We overheard one of the people at the agency tell his co-worker to charge us triple of their normal asking price \"because these Americans are filthy rich anyway\". Naturally, we immediately switched to Spanish to let them know we heard and understood everything. They were so mortified we only had to pay half of the normal asking price. —elodied49a59e38e\\n\\n14. And finally, this wholesome customer: I walked into a take-out restaurant in Providence, Rhode Island just minutes before closing time. Immediately the two employees started talking to each other in Spanish, viciously complaining about me walking in and expecting service so late. THEY. WERE. FURIOUS. Foul language and all. Then they proceed to ask me in English what I wanted , so I give them my order in my native language, Spanish. The poor girls immediately bury their face in their hands, and apologize to me saying they were actually talking about someone else they served before me. One of the girls was so embarrassed she was about to cry. I told them not to worry and that I understood their frustration. They had been working non-stop all day long. I would be tired and pissed too. I left a 20% tip, thanked them for the food and went home. —n499ae0620\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nNote: Submissions have been edited for length and/or clarity.\\n\\nWant to be featured in similar BuzzFeed posts?

Bush more than a decade ago. Democrats had objected to an earlier decision by the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Republican leadership not to make the emails public.\\n\\nThe third day of the confirmation hearing of the conservative federal appeals court judge selected by Trump for a lifetime post on the high court again was repeatedly interrupted by protesters hostile to Kavanaugh.\\n\\nIn a 2003 email, Kavanaugh suggested striking a line from a draft opinion piece that had stated “it is widely accepted by legal scholars across the board that Roe v. Wade and its progeny are the settled law of the land,” saying that the Supreme Court could overturn it.\\n\\nAsked about that document, Kavanaugh said he suggested the change because he thought the draft language was overstating the thinking of legal scholars at the time. He again declined to say whether the landmark 1973 ruling that legalized abortion nationwide, Roe v. Wade, was correctly decided, though he indicated - as he also had on Wednesday - that it is a decision that merits respect.\\n\\n“Roe v. Wade is an important precedent of the Supreme Court. It has been reaffirmed many times,” Kavanaugh told the panel.\\n\\nDemocratic Senator Cory Booker focused on an email he said described Kavanaugh’s views as a Bush White House aide on the use of “racial profiling” in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States by the al Qaeda Islamist militant group.\\n\\nIn the 2002 email, Kavanaugh said that although he favored race-neutral policies in policing, there was an “interim question of what to do before a truly effective and comprehensive race-neutral system is developed and implemented.”\\n\\nKavanaugh wrote in another email from 2001 that some U.S. Transportation Department affirmative action regulations used “a lot of legalisms and disguises to mask what is a naked racial set-aside.” Affirmative action refers to policies that favor groups like racial minorities in practices such as hiring that have experienced past discrimination.\\n\\nIf confirmed by the Senate, Kavanaugh is seen as likely to tilt the nation’s highest judicial body even further to the right. That prospect worries Democrats and heartens Republicans on volatile issues including abortion, gun rights, gay rights, the death penalty, religious liberty and business regulation.\\n\\nSupreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh testifies during the third day of his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., September 6, 2018. REUTERS/Alex Wroblewski\\n\\nAs on Wednesday, Kavanaugh faced questions on presidential power, some reflecting on his time working for Bush. In one exchange with Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, Kavanaugh stressed the importance of lawyers pushing back against a president.\\n\\n“Lawyers need to have backbone even in pressured moments to say ‘no.’ One of the most important responsibilities of an executive branch lawyer in the passions of the moment when the pressure’s on, when the president wants to do something, perhaps is to go into the Oval Office and say, ‘No, you shouldn’t do this,’” said Kavanaugh, who a day earlier also told the committee that “no one is above the law.”\\n\\n‘A SHAM’\\n\\nThe hearing opened with Democrats complaining that the documents had not already been made public by the committee’s Republican leaders. They were released minutes later.\\n\\nBooker called the process used by the committee to decide which documents to make public “a bit of sham,” a characterization rejected by the panel’s chairman, Chuck Grassley.\\n\\nRepublican Senator John Cornyn took issue with Booker’s comments.\\n\\n“No senator deserves to sit on this committee or serve in the Senate, in my view, if they decide to be a law unto themselves and willingly flout the rules of the Senate and the determination of confidentiality and classification. That is irresponsible and conduct unbecoming a senator,” he said.\\n\\n“Running for president is no excuse for violating the rules of the Senate or of the confidentiality of the documents that we are privy to,” Cornyn added.\\n\\nTwo of the Democratic senators who have been most forceful in the Kavanaugh hearing, Booker and Kamala Harris, are considered potential 2020 presidential candidates.\\n\\nAfter more questions from senators on Thursday, the hearing is set to wrap up on Friday with testimony from outside witnesses. Republicans hope Kavanaugh will be confirmed by the Senate before the next Supreme Court term starts on Oct. 1.\\n\\nSenate Democrats have vowed a tough fight to block Kavanaugh.

This time, it was for Autumn Scardina, an Arvada woman celebrating her birthday and the seventh anniversary of her gender transition.\\n\\nThe commission’s June opinion came despite Phillips’ earlier win at the U.S. Supreme Court over his refusal to make a cake for a gay wedding, the lawsuit says.\\n\\n“The state of Colorado is ignoring the message of the U.S. Supreme Court by continuing to single out Jack for punishment and to exhibit hostility toward his religious beliefs,” said Kristen Waggoner, legal vice president of Alliance Defending Freedom, the organization representing Phillips.\\n\\nHowever, the justices’ 7-2 decision in the cake maker’s earlier case was a narrow ruling that kept the state’s nondiscrimination laws intact but said the state commission did not appropriately weigh Phillips’ religious rights.\\n\\nHickenlooper told reporters Wednesday that he was not involved the commission’s most recent ruling, but said the issue is one of the most thorny he has seen during his public service career. He said he expects the issue to return to the U.S. Supreme Court.\\n\\n“The first ruling from the Supreme Court did not address the basic issue,” he said, referring to the religious freedom issue, “and that’s what I think the U.S. Supreme Court will have to address this time.”\\n\\nThe Civil Rights Commission and attorney general’s office declined to comment Wednesday. Attorney General Cynthia Coffman, a Republican, has long been a supporter of the LGBTQ community.\\n\\nTuesday’s lawsuit reignites years of legal debate over how religious beliefs should be considered under Colorado’s public accommodation law. The 2008 state law forbids businesses from discriminating against customers on a variety of grounds including sexual orientation and gender.\\n\\nPhillips and his cake shop first made national news in 2012, when he declined to make a wedding cake for a gay couple because of his religious objections to same-sex marriage. The years-long legal fight ended at the U.S. Supreme Court this June in a decision written by Justice Anthony Kennedy. Kennedy, who has authored a number of landmark rulings expanding gay rights, indicated that the decision was not all-encompassing.\\n\\nAt the time, observers on both sides of the case said the limited decision meant the broader debate would continue to be litigated.\\n\\nOn June 26, 2017, Scardina, a lawyer, filed a complaint with the commission claiming that the cake shop denied her request for a cake — blue on the outside and pink on the inside to represent her transition.\\n\\nA store employee declined the request because the custom cake would have expressed messages about sex and gender identity that conflict with Phillips’ religious beliefs, according to Scardina’s complaint with the Civil Rights Commission.\\n\\n“The woman on the phone did not object to my request for a birthday cake until I told her I was celebrating my transition from male to female,” Scardina wrote in her complaint. “I believe that I was not allowed to order a birthday cake because I requested that its colors celebrate my transition.”\\n\\nScardina on Wednesday did not return requests to comment.\\n\\nIn a June 28 decision letter, the commission wrote that there was probable cause to believe Masterpiece violated a state law by denying Scardina “equal enjoyment of a place of public accommodation.” The letter ordered the bakery and Scardina to attempt an amicable resolution by compulsory mediation, according to Phillips’ legal team.\\n\\nJim Campbell, another lawyer for Phillips, said in a statement that Phillips shouldn’t have to fear government hostility when he opens his shop for business each day.\\n\\n“We’re asking the court to put a stop to that,” Campbell said. “The arbitrary basis on which the state is applying its law makes clear that its officials are targeting Jack because they despise his religious beliefs and practices.”\\n\\nOne Colorado, the state’s largest LGBTQ advocacy organization, said the new lawsuit was one of several filed in an effort to legalize discrimination.\\n\\n“All people — including LGBTQ people — deserve to be served equally in public spaces, and no religious belief gives anyone the right to pick and choose whom they serve and what laws they want to follow,” Daniel Ramos, One Colorado’s executive director, said in a statement. “This is another attempt by the ADF to undermine laws that protect Coloradans in the areas of public accommodations, employment, and housing.”\\n\\nEarlier this year, the state’s civil rights commission became a political flashpoint during the state’s regular legislative session. Some conservative lawmakers attempted to shut down the commission in part because of its role in the Masterpiece cake controversy.\\n\\nUltimately, Hickenlooper signed a bipartisan compromise that extended the commission through 2027 and changed the makeup of the commission, requiring it be more bipartisan.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, the governor denounced discrimination, saying “it’s not what America stands for.” He also stressed that he understood the value of a person’s religion freedom.\\n\\n“This is a difficult question.

As local sake brewers can attest, the path has been far cloudier for those trying to bring the traditional Japanese spirit to the masses.\\n\\nThanks to a law passed by the Colorado General Assembly this spring, the road map gets much clearer Wednesday. Sake, a rice-based beverage brewed like beer but noncarbonated and higher in alcohol like wine, has been added to the state liquor code as a “vinous liquor.”\\n\\n“As of Aug. 8, sake will be regulated like a wine in the state of Colorado,” state department of revenue spokesman Lawrence Pacheco said. “That means that residents will be able to buy sake in winery sales rooms.”\\n\\nIf things go according to plan, Colorado Sake Co. will open the state’s first sake tasting room in Denver’s RiNo district in September. The business, a self-financed operation based in a 1,000-square-foot brew space behind Wine & Whey at 3559 Larimer St., was a major driver behind the law change. Now, it hopes to be at the forefront of a sake wave.\\n\\n“We’ve always loved sake and we wondered why don’t more people drink sake,” Heather Dennis, one of the company’s co-owners said last week as she and her partners worked to stockpile inventory in advance of the new sales rules. “We realized it was an issue with access or lack of access. That’s why we want the tasting room. To introduce and educate people.”\\n\\nColorado Sake Co.’s origins date back to 2016. That’s when co-founder William Stuart went to an event where he tasted sake made by Denver-based brewer Gaijin 24886.\\n\\n“I said, ‘I can do that,’ ” Stuart recalled. He went home, found a recipe online and kicked his roommates out of the fridge so he could ferment his creation at the requisite 50 degrees.\\n\\nSake has four ingredients: rice, water, yeast and koji, an Asian culinary ingredient made of steamed rice that has sprouted mold spores. Unlike beer, where yeast is added to malted grain after it cooks to produce alcohol, all the ingredients in sake brew simultaneously in a process called multiple parallel fermentation.\\n\\nStuart said it took him a year to master making koji. From there, he experimented until developing a sake recipe he was pleased with. In May 2017, he and his partners went to the state to get a limited winery license. They were rejected.\\n\\n“We were told, ‘You’re manufacturing beer and you’re selling wine,'” Stuart said.\\n\\nBecause of narrow definitions in the state liquor code, a rule change was needed to include and regulate sake. While it is well-known to consumers — often served hot, or in the form of a shot dropped into a beer, much to the chagrin of its advocates and aficionados — it is only produced by about 20 brewers in the Unites States today, according advocacy group the Sake Education Council.\\n\\nAfter being denied a license, the Colorado Sake Co. team embarked on a journey through the state lawmaking process that included talking to legislators, dealing with lobbyists and fielding questions from wineries and big-time beer makers, Stuart said. Finally, with the help of primary sponsors state Sen. Lucia Guzman, D-Denver, and Rep. Dan Pabon, D-Denver, the change was signed into law on April 11.\\n\\n“Ever since the days of Hakushika Sake in Golden, sake has kind of occupied this sort of gray area in the liquor code,” said Doug Caskey, executive director of the Colorado Wine Industry Development Board, an offshoot of the state department of agriculture dedicated to marketing local wine, cider, mead and, now, sake. “It was really great we got this law changed.”\\n\\nHakushika Sake USA Corp., a private Japanese company, shut down in 2001, state records show.\\n\\nGaijin 24886 lost its space because of the new law, founder and brewer Marc Hughes said. The facility was licensed for beer production, not wine. But Gaijin is focused on the positives. It is working on finding a new location with aims to open a tasting room by next summer. In the meantime, a few varieties of Gaijin can be purchased at Divino Wine & Spirits at 1240 S. Broadway.\\n\\n“There is a lot of interest in experimentation with different things in town,” Hughes said of sake’s prospects in a crowded Denver liquor market. “It’s just about finding the right way to capture it.”\\n\\nColorado Sake Co. isn’t being distributed in liquor stores at the moment, but its flagship varieties, American Standard and the cinnamon and vanilla flavored Horchata Nigori, are on tap at Mizu Izakaya in Highland. The restaurant, at 1560 Boulder St., carries at least 50 sakes per season. Colorado Sake Co. is the only American brand it stocks.\\n\\n“I think that it’s just incredible that we are going to have the opportunity to get sake into more and more consumers’ hands,” Mizu beverage director Jerrica Ash said. “My goal is to make sake a spirit that in every restaurant not just in Asian restaurants.”\", 'clickbait': array(['0'], dtype='<U1')}\n",

It’s a pilot project designed to demonstrate tiny homes, arranged in a community where rules are set by the residents themselves, should be part of the solution to combating homelessness in Denver.\\n\\nIt’s had its challenges. Two of the original residents returned to the streets after their neighbors asked them to leave for violating village rules. The village had to move about 200 feet in January — from one side of its lot to the other — at a cost of $25,000 because of now-changed city rules governing temporary residential structures. The city chipped in $10,000.\\n\\nBut Beloved has persevered. A year after opening, supporters are touting the results of a University of Denver study of the village as proof it is improving lives, both for its residents who were chronically homeless and in the surrounding community.\\n\\n“Unfortunately, the residents here have had to be the guinea pigs, but they have helped us sort out some of the issues that will help improve the model as we scale into the future,” Cole Chandler, a member of the Colorado Village Collaborative, said. “We intend to see dozens of these villages across the metro area.”\\n\\nThe study assessed the village from its opening on July 21, 2017, through April. Among the key findings:\\n\\nOf the 12 original village residents who participated in the study — one person declined — 10 remained housed through April. It goes beyond the scope of the study, but those 10 people are still in stable housing today, Chandler said,\\n\\nThree residents moved out of the village into housing of their own. Two of them, a couple, saved up for their own apartment, Chandler said. A third person was approved for Section 8 rental assistance.\\n\\nAnd all villagers — nine of whom were already working when they moved in — were either employed, in school or collecting disability, as of April. That fact also holds true today.\\n\\nTo read the full findings of the study, visit bartoninstitute.org/tiny-homes.\\n\\nThere were 5,317 people experiencing homelessness in Denver and seven surrounding counties in January, according to a point-in-time report compiled by the Metro Denver Homeless Initiative. For Chandler, whose organization was created to help establish and support tiny home villages in Denver, the study demonstrates that more communities like Beloved should be built in the metro area and soon.\\n\\n“The idea was to build low-barrier housing for people with barriers to accessing the existing system” he said, noting each tiny home cost $22,000 to build. “With traditional housing-first scenarios, there are a lot of overhead costs with all of the support systems that they create, which are very helpful for a large portion of the population. We can do things at a lower cost.”\\n\\nThe study was performed by the DU’s Burns Center on Poverty and Homelessness. It was commissioned by the Barton Institute for Philanthropy and Social Enterprise, also a part of DU. The institute has invested a combined $91,725in building and assessing the Beloved village and a proposed second village that Chandler’s group is seeking to build in Denver, director Rebecca Arno said.\\n\\nArno suspects the village’s self-governing model, with residents setting guidelines for behavior and other aspects of community life, has empowered the people living there.\\n\\nCersilla Wolf, one of the village’s charter members, has enrolled in college classes, opened an Etsy.com shop selling her own crocheted wares and began working at nearby Bigsby’s Folly Winery & Restaurant in RiNo, which reached out to the Colorado Village Collaborative about hiring a villager.\\n\\nWolf also has taken on the mantle of resident finder. She built a second, lofted bed into her home and brought in two other people struggling to find stable housing to live with her.\\n\\nFreddie Martin has been Wolf’s roommate since March after meeting her on the Metro State University campus. A history major who takes notes during village meetings to “create a historical record,” Martin said he hasn’t had a secure home in about a decade. He’s paid rent to live with friends but hasn’t been able to raise the money — including a security deposit and first and last month’s rent — to move out on his own. Now housed, he hopes to finish his degree in the fall.\\n\\n“This place has been a godsend,” Martin said.\\n\\nWolf’s first roommate, Kim Grier, lives next door now. The 27-year-old is trying to get a photography business off the ground while working at King Soopers.\\n\\n“When I got this house, this was the first place I ever had to live that wasn’t dependent on my emotional relationship with another person,” she said. “It’s a place that’s yours, where you can think.”\\n\\nThe DU study also examined the village’s impact on the surrounding neighborhood. Combining responses from a random sampling of nearby residents and a selective sampling of business owners, researchers found 78 percent of people in the area believe the village either didn’t hurt community safety or helped it — a perception supported by crime data.\\n\\n“Even the people who at the beginning of this process told me this will never work, this will be a disaster, have come back and said, ‘Wow, were we wrong,’ ” said RiNo Art District president Jamie Giellis. “It’s been awesome.”\\n\\nThe Village won’t be behind its colorful fence at 38th and Blake much longer. Chandler said an agreement is in place with a new property owner host, but he’s not ready to say where until more community outreach can be done. Colorado Village Collaborative hopes to raise $90,000 for a new commons building for the village when it does move, one with running water, three bathrooms and a full kitchen.\\n\\nUrban Land Conservancy, the nonprofit that owns the land Beloved sits on today, is moving forward with plans to develop the lot. The Walnut Street side will be turned into 66 affordable apartments in partnership with Medici Communities, conservancy president Aaron Miripol said. The Blake Street half will be sold to local developer McWhinney, which expects to build a 16-story mixed-use building that will also house Urban Land Conservancy’s office.\\n\\nColorado Village Collaborative was dealt a setback this month when Denver’s Landmark Preservation Commission voted that it could not proceed with building an eight-home women’s village on the property of St. Andrew’s Episcopal Church at 2015 Glenarm Place because it didn’t fit with the surrounding historic district.\\n\\nThe vote was a temporary setback in Chandler’s view. He plans to meet next week with another property owner who he says has offered to host the women’s village for three years. He hopes to get it built before winter.\\n\\nMiripol, who has been involved with efforts to provide stable housing for people in need for decades, said he has been frustrated by the barriers that have cropped up and prevented the tiny home concept from growing in Denver and beyond.

It serves nearly all of Westminster north of West 92nd Avenue and south of 124th Avenue.\\n\\nAfter being briefed about the sewer’s capacity, age and condition issues last week, the City Council on Monday night unanimously adopted an emergency ordinance that freezes acceptance of new, large-scale development proposals in the area served by the Big Dry Creek network for up to a year.\\n\\n“The (sewer) system is now at a trigger point of risk that warrants both near-term mitigation measures, as well as longer-term expansion to support continued development,” a staff memo recommending the emergency ordinance read. “Not addressing these system constraints is believed to compromise the health, safety, and welfare of the community with a level of risk that is not acceptable.”\\n\\nThe moratorium, which went into effect at noon on Tuesday, is designed to allow a consultant to inspect the sewer, collecting information that will be put to use in a project to fix, expand and replace portions of it, according to a city memo. City staff are expected to work simultaneously to pinpoint spots for where incremental or innovative fixes could be employed and make plans for easements and land acquisitions that might be required by future repair and replace projects. One idea floated at Monday’s meeting was reactivating decommissioned sewer lines in the area to help with capacity.\\n\\nThe Big Dry Creek system was first assessed in 2012, then again in 2015, according to the city staff. Those studies found “several segments” of the system were nearing the end of their lifespan or were not large enough to handle all of development and growth in the city. The city made plans to overhaul the system starting in 2019 director of public works and utilities Max Kirschbaum said Monday.\\n\\nBut an assessment done earlier this year — when factoring in projects in the city’s pipeline and flows those could contribute to the sewer system — painted a dire picture. Kirschbaum said the system is already running the risk of a sanitary sewer overflow, an event where raw sewage escapes from a sanitary sewer.\\n\\nWestminster’s sewer flows have increased by 40 percent since 2008, city officials said. The Big Dry System was dates back to the 1970s, before the city went through several waves of population growth.\\n\\nThe moratorium applies to new development applications that would increase flows into the Big Dry Creek network. Home renovations or projects that will not add to the sewage flows will not be subject to the freeze, officials said.\\n\\nApplications and pre-applications submitted prior to the moratorium taking effect will be honored. But developers who fail to follow up a pre-application meeting with more complete planning documents within six months will see their projects expire, according to the city.\\n\\nEven if a developer has city approval to move forward with plans, they may not be given access to the sewer system. Westminster’s municipal code dictates wastewater service commitments do not take hold until a building permit is pulled. That means builders in the affected area who goes in for building permits may be told the sewer network does not have the capacity to serve their projects. Access to the sewer system will be assessed and awarded on a first-come, first-served basis to ensure fairness, city officials say.\\n\\nJenni Grafton, the city’s acting economic development director, estimated there are between 30 and 40 projects in the affected area that could be in line to pull permits. Some of the city’s premier mixed-used neighborhoods and shopping areas will not be impacted by the development freeze. The Downtown Westminster project, rising where the Westminster Mall once stood, and the Westminster Station transit-oriented development going up around the city’s B-Line train stop, are served by a separate sewer network. The same is true for its north Interstate 25 and Huron Street business district. Those areas include the St. Antony North Health Campus and the Orchard Town Center shopping area.\\n\\nSeveral developers that have projects on tap in Westminster came to Monday’s meeting to urge the council to move along their projects. Council members sought to assuage fears.\\n\\nCouncilwoman Shannon Bird said, “We are not closed for business.”\\n\\nThe city will lift the moratorium before 12 months if possible, but its sewer contractor is expected to need nine months to assess the system. Mayor Herb Atchison preached patience.\\n\\n“We need to get the study done first,” he said. “How big is (the problem) and how long do we think it will take us to fix it? That’s not going to happen in 12 months.”\\n\\nIt is unclear how much it might cost Westminster to address the emergency, but city staff did say where they expect much of the money to come from: sewer rate hikes and municipal debt.', 'clickbait': array(['0'], dtype='<U1')}\n",

The first 1,000 shoppers get a free reusable bag.\\n\\nIt remains to be seen if that event will generate the same kind of fervor H&M did. After all, Target is well known in Colorado, having operated stores here for decades. It’s got brand recognition but isn’t trendy or new like its Scandinavian counterpart.\\n\\nRegardless of how many people line up before the new store’s doors are flung open at 1600 California St., downtown business advocates are ecstatic over its arrival and what it says about the economic vitality of a portion of Denver sporting a retail vacancy rate of 3.3 percent.\\n\\n“When Target chooses to locate somewhere they are sending a message that the customer base is there,” Downtown Denver Partnership CEO Tami Door said Monday. “This shows this brand has identified the center city of Denver — and it sends this message to other brands — as a place where they believe they will be successful.”\\n\\nThe 16th Street Mall store won’t be just any Target. At 30,000 square feet, it’s less than quarter the size of the retailer’s average store. It will feature a curated collection of goods designed to appeal to downtown shoppers, Ashlee Justis, the store’s team lead, said.\\n\\nOn its main floor, the second floor of the 1600 California St. building, shoppers will find clothes and accessories — including Broncos and other local team gear — and an electronics and entertainment department complete with cellphones that can be activated on the spot. There will be a grocery section with fresh produce and frozen goods, as well as grab-and-go items such as sandwiches, meant to cater to customers popping in and out on their lunch breaks.\\n\\nFloor two will carry cosmetics and personal care products and travel goods — again catering to a specific downtown market segment: tourists. There will also be an assortment of home wares and decor, a category H&M added to its 16th Street Mall store in 2015.\\n\\n“Why this is going to be so exciting, especially for the downtown Denver guest, is this store is created especially for them,” Justis said. “It’s going to be a quick, convenient spot to get those products you have relied on Target for traditionally.”\\n\\nDoubling down on the convenience, the store will have a CVS pharmacy and self-checkout kiosks. It will also serve as the order pickup point for people who buy from Target.com, company officials say. Place an order on the website, and within an hour that item will be ready at the store.\\n\\nThe store is an example of Target’s real estate evolution. After going from big to jumbo in the form of its Super Target store formats, the company is now going small. When the 16th Street Mall store opens it will be one of 71 small format stores the retailer has opened across the country. Meant to fit in denser urban centers or near college campuses, the smaller footprint allows Target close places it hasn’t been before, such as downtown Denver, company spokeswoman Jacqueline DeBuse said.\\n\\n“We’ve always been interested in the (downtown) Denver community,” DeBuse said. “We know there are daytime professionals and round-the-clock residents.”\\n\\nDeBuse’s reference to round-the-clock residents offers a potential clue as to why it has taken Target so long to hit its mark downtown. The Downtown Denver Partnership’s CEO Door said her organization has been working on bringing the brand to the city’s urban core for decades. Every time an opportunity came up, some factor dragged it down, whether the location or property owner wasn’t the right fit, or Target not being in an expansion mode at the time, or the demographics not being strong enough.\\n\\n“When you’re working to attract a retail location, everything has to be right,” she said.\\n\\nIn downtown Denver today — defined by the partnership as the area made up of the Auraria, Lower Downtown, Ballpark, Central Platte Valley, Golden Triangle and Center Business District neighborhoods — more people are working, visiting and living than ever before. Randy Thelen, the partnership’s vice president of economic development, said 23,000 people live downtown, three times as many as 2000. The area’s 136,000 employees is an all-time high.

Of those, 3,076 are still under suppression orders that keep the details away from the public — 345 are felony criminal cases — as they work their way through the legal system, according to state computer records.\\n\\nUntil recently, no information about any of the suppressed cases was available publicly — not the names of the defendants, the charges they faced or even the identity of the judges who closed them — until The Post began questioning the practice.\\n\\nThe Post identified 66 felony cases that remained closed to the public — including homicides and sex crimes requiring registration as a sexual offender — even though the defendants had already been convicted and sentenced, some to lengthy prison terms.\\n\\nIn every suppressed case, The Post found, the judge’s suppression order and the reasons supporting it are shielded from public scrutiny. Courthouse employees and many law enforcement officials, including prosecutors, will not even acknowledge the suppressed cases exist, The Post found.\\n\\nThat means someone could be arrested, charged, convicted and sent to prison in Colorado without anyone seeing why, how or where, and whether the process was fair.\\n\\n“This sounds like the Star Chamber to me,” said Alan Chen, a constitutional law professor at University of Denver’s Sturm College of Law, referring to the 15th-century English court chastised for arbitrary rulings and secret proceedings. “Colorado is one of the worst states in terms of access to criminal court records for reasons I really have no explanation for. I’ve not heard of this being practiced anywhere else in the country. It’s frightening that if anything improper is going on, no one will know about it or have any way to find out.”\\n\\nAlthough courtrooms remain open to the public, including hearings for suppressed cases, the only way to know when a hearing is to occur is to be there when it is scheduled. A Denver Post reporter happened to attend one hearing in which a murder suspect pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit first-degree murder, and no public record of the event existed. The only way to learn the defendant’s name was to be there when the judge announced it.\\n\\nAccording to interviews and analysis of cases that were later opened to the public, the reasons behind a suppression order are varied: Prosecutors don’t want to alarm other members of a drug ring as they’re being rounded up; the case involves a juvenile defendant; or law enforcement says a criminal investigation is ongoing. Civil cases have been suppressed as well, typically — though not all — to shield victims of abuse or sexual assaults from publicity.\\n\\nBut there are other reasons as well. The Post found one criminal case — that of a board member and part-owner of the Broomfield Academy charged and convicted of felony sexual assault of a child and misdemeanor child abuse — in which prosecutors requested and received a suppression order to avoid publicity. The case remains suppressed.\\n\\nIt found another — of a member of the Adams County 14 school board eventually convicted with attempting to lure a child for sex — in which the judge ordered the suppression at the outset, without anyone even asking for it, because the judge “had concerns about releasing information,” records obtained by The Post show. The case remains suppressed.\\n\\nThe case of Clifford Galley, 28, convicted of attempted first-degree murder, was one of a number The Post found that remained suppressed long after the defendant went to prison. Galley was sentenced to 169 years in prison and won’t see freedom in his lifetime. Documents related to the case were suppressed after his arrest in 2013 and no one except for his lawyer, prosecutors or a judge could see them. Last month, a judge lifted the suppression order after The Post asked prosecutors questions about it. His appeal, however, remains suppressed.\\n\\nDenver Post emails to several of the judges responsible for suppressed cases went unanswered except for one, and that judge passed it along to state court administrators to respond.\\n\\nSuppressed cases are different than those sealed by the court, the reasons for which are limited by state law. Sealed cases are restricted to those where a defendant was exonerated or, under certain conditions, the case was dismissed, such as with a deferred sentence. Some low-level drug felonies can also be sealed under specific criteria.\\n\\nBy contrast, a judge may suppress a case for any reason at his or her discretion — usually, but not always, at the request of lawyers in the case, but most frequently prosecutors. Once a case is suppressed, it remains so until a judge reopens it, which The Post found often does not happen because neither defense lawyers nor prosecutors ever bother to ask.\\n\\n“This isn’t right; it can’t be right. It’s a chance for them to victimize our family all over again,” said Mark Chalfant, whose son, Mark, was killed in a Taco Bell parking lot in Aurora in July 2014. Four teenagers were convicted in the case — one as a juvenile — yet all the records remain closed under suppression orders three years later.\\n\\nHow news coverage of two high-profile sex-crime cases faded after they were suppressed by Colorado judges Douglas County sheriff’s officers had arrested one of their own — Deputy Robert “Mike” French — in the early hours of Feb. 9, 2013, on suspicion of trying to lure a 16-year-old boy into a sexual relationship. It was a Saturday and French, then 41, was taken to the Douglas County Detention Facility at about 3:30 a.m. He was kept there until he was to appear before a judge two days later. On Monday morning, before any word that French had been arrested was made public, Senior Deputy District Attorney Jay Williford asked a judge to suppress the case and all the information surrounding French’s arrest and the crimes he was accused of committing, court records show. The judge agreed. Continue reading\\n\\nAlthough media attention about the shooting and the arrests was widespread, the court cases were immediately suppressed. Only the 30-year sentence of triggerman Sterling Hook made a headline in a local newspaper a year later — after prosecutors released the information.\\n\\n“No one else ever gets to know what they’ve done,” Chalfant said, noting that no one other than family attended court hearings spread over a year. “That’s just wrong.“\\n\\nCourt records “critically important”\\n\\nOpen-records experts and several attorneys interviewed by The Post were troubled by the newspaper’s findings, saying it runs against the Colorado and U.S. constitutions and their guarantee of an open and accessible court system.\\n\\n“Court records in general are a critically important source of information for the public,” said Jeff Roberts, executive director of the Colorado Freedom of Information Coalition. “Without access to court records and proceedings, Coloradans can’t monitor the judicial system. They can’t know whether it’s working properly or not.”\\n\\nThe Colorado Supreme Court in June refused to declare that access to court records is an absolute right guaranteed by the First Amendment or the Colorado Constitution. But that decision dealt with a specific document that had been sealed within a court file, not the entire case itself or its details.\\n\\nThe Post’s investigation also found:\\n\\n— Most suppressed cases had scant or no media attention, and the majority of the few that did were typically at the time of a defendant’s arrest, before anything was suppressed by a judge. Several suppressed cases did get press coverage when charges were filed and again after a defendant was sentenced, when prosecutors issued an announcement — but nothing in between.\\n\\n— Until recently, no trace of a suppressed case existed in the public-access computers the state provides at county courthouses throughout Colorado, or the online for-pay services that compile the same data and the state recommends to the public. That has changed since The Post began inquiring. Until last week, the public still could not see what charges had been brought against a person in a suppressed case or see any details about it, such as the next court hearing or any sentence given.\\n\\n— Sealed cases are restricted by law to only the judge who issued the order, and acknowledging their existence is prohibited. Public information about suppressed cases, however, per Colorado Supreme Court rule, should include names and case numbers, though the details of a case and the courtroom proceedings around it have been restricted. Despite that, court officials and some prosecutors’ offices still treat the two types of cases as the same and refuse to give any information about a suppressed case.\\n\\n— Public schedules posted daily outside of courtrooms, called dockets, show the cases being heard that day, including the names of defendants. If the case is suppressed, however, the docket only shows that a time is allotted for a hearing, but not why or for whom.\\n\\n— Even high-profile cases that received intense publicity are under suppression orders, meaning access to any of their court records today is prohibited. Among them: Aurora theater shooter James Holmes; witness killers Sir Mario Owens and Robert Ray; and Jessica Ridgeway killer Austin Sigg. The media was able to follow these cases by appearing at a public court hearing to learn when the next was to be held. Many times prosecutors and defense lawyers say they simply forgot the case was still suppressed.\\n\\n“That’s very troubling”\\n\\nThe Denver Post began investigating suppressed cases in Colorado nearly a year ago after reporters were denied access to records and expressed concern about the practice. The Post obtained data from the State Court Administrator that helped it determine the extent to which suppressions have been used in each judicial district in Colorado. The Post then reviewed dozens of suppressed cases that have been unsuppressed to see how the practice was being used.\\n\\nSince 2013, there have been 6,707 cases suppressed by judges in Colorado, and the bulk of them were criminal cases, The Post found — misdemeanors first, then felonies, followed by civil court matters. A judge’s suppression order was lifted in 3,631 of them, meaning the public can now access the cases, sometimes soon after a defendant was arrested or parties to a civil lawsuit were served with court papers, records show.\\n\\n“Generally it’s one thing to suppress a (single) document, which is very legitimate, but when entire files begin to disappear from the public record, that’s very troubling,” Denver attorney Larry Pozner said. “We’re very skeptical in America of things done in the dark, and other than juvenile law, you can walk into an American courtroom and take notes, and they can’t say, ‘It’s none of your business, get out of here.’ ”\\n\\nThe Post’s analysis found that the number of suppressed cases varies dramatically from county to county. Prosecutors in La Plata County, where Durango is the county seat, have suppressed 366 felony cases over the past five years, the most by any jurisdiction, records show. But those cases were nearly always unsuppressed once a defendant was arrested and brought to court, the longest taking two years, The Post found.\\n\\n“It’s not uncommon to suppress a case until the defendant is arrested and the warrant served,” said Christian Champagne, district attorney for Colorado’s Sixth Judicial District that includes La Plata, Archuleta and San Juan counties. “Ours is an area where people come through and leave for long stretches of time.”\\n\\nIn the 18th Judicial District, which is made up of Arapahoe, Douglas, Lincoln and Elbert counties, 62 cases are still suppressed from public view even though the defendants have been tried, convicted and sentenced, The Post found, the highest among the state’s 22 judicial districts. The majority of the cases — 47, most of them from a single drug-conspiracy investigation from four years ago — are in Arapahoe County, followed by 14 others in Douglas County, and one in Elbert County.\\n\\nThat total doesn’t include 115 active felony cases that are still under suppression in the district — nearly half the statewide total, The Post found.\\n\\n“I still think there are some legitimate reasons on behalf of the safety of certain victims and witnesses … that we ought to have the ability to continue to suppress those,” 18th Judicial District Attorney George Brauchler said.\\n\\nIn 2015, prosecutors asked that the Douglas County sex-assault case against Broomfield Academy then-owner and board member Michael Greenberg, 62, be suppressed because it likely would garner a lot of media attention. A television station reported his arrest. There was no media report after the suppression order was issued. The private school is to close this year, according to its website.\\n\\nThe case has remained suppressed ever since even though Greenberg pleaded guilty to felony sexual assault of a child in which he received a four-year deferred sentence, and to a misdemeanor charge of child abuse. He is a registered sex-offender in Centennial, records show. Following The Post’s inquiry, prosecutors have asked a judge to unsuppress the case.\\n\\n“Our office filed a motion to suppress, the reason being is that the case would be subject to extensive pretrial publicity,” Brauchler’s Senior Chief Deputy District Attorney Rich Orman told The Post in an email, saying he and Brauchler were not consulted by the DA who handled the case. “This was a mistake, and we should not have sought suppression of a court file for this reason.”\\n\\nBrauchler said suppression orders sometimes are important to solving serious crimes, but concedes that once their usefulness is over, cases should not remain hidden from public scrutiny.\\n\\n“Already in many cases, specifically gang and some domestic violence cases, the concern over an individual’s own safety is so strong that if you can’t provide some other assurance, even in the short-term, I think we’ll lose out on cooperation from a lot of key witnesses,” Brauchler said. “But the public should maintain the ability to scrutinize what we do, why we do it and how we go about that.”\\n\\nAfter speaking with The Post, Brauchler’s office began unsuppressing many of the cases and instituted policies limiting how the practice should be used in the future. There are some cases, however, that Brauchler said should remain suppressed for the safety of the defendant — one of whom is serving a 16-year prison term in a rural county jail after having testified against another defendant who was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison, records show.\\n\\nThere have been no suppressed cases involving a criminal defendant in Denver District Court the past five years, the years The Post reviewed, according to records.\\n\\n“This is just a completely foreign procedure in my years of experience as a district attorney,” said former Denver District Attorney Mitch Morrissey. “In my 33 years, I don’t know what you’re talking about. I’ve never even heard of suppressing an entire case. How can you have cases that don’t even show up on a court docket? I’ve never seen such a thing.”\\n\\nExperts in open-records law say the practice of suppressing entire cases rubs against the grain of a system intended to be transparent.\\n\\n“The most outrageous, unjustifiable and unconstitutional thing you’ve found is the public being denied the right to know which cases are on file in our courts of law against which defendants, and to have access, at the minimum, to the indexes of those cases,” said Denver attorney Steven Zansberg, an expert on open-records laws who represents a number of media outlets including The Denver Post.\\n\\n“How is there a case where the public doesn’t know how or why someone is arrested or in prison?” he asked. “Courts throughout the land have held the public — we the people — have a constitutional First Amendment right to have access to those records.”\\n\\nMany cases suppressed\\n\\nWhen Frank Huner Jr., a 58-year-old Sedalia man, was charged in July 2017 with first-degree murder for allegedly killing his son, whom he said he mistook for an intruder, news of his arrest peppered the media.\\n\\nSince then, however, there’s been not a word about the Douglas County case — and not a single reference to it could be found anywhere among the state’s courthouse databases available for the public to search criminal and civil cases. Courthouse employees refused to identify the case even existed.\\n\\nDuring the course of The Post’s investigation, the State Court Administrator has changed the computer programs that provide the public with information about criminal and civil cases so that a defendant’s name, case number and the county where the case is being heard is displayed.\\n\\nUntil a week ago the public could not see the charges they faced or details about a suppressed case’s progress through the judicial system.\\n\\nSuch is the case of Daniel Pesch, a 34-year-old Littleton man charged in December 2017 for the 2010 murder of Kiowa High School science teacher Randy Wilson. The case has been suppressed since the moment it was filed, even though the media covered Pesch’s arrest. It’s only been recently unsuppressed after dozens of hearings. Still, several key portions of the case remain concealed from public view.\\n\\nAs well with Jeffrey Falk, 54, a former ThunderRidge High School math teacher sentenced in June 2016 to 21 years in prison for victimizing young boys and collecting “a library of child porn.” He had pleaded guilty in Arapahoe County district court to three counts of sexual exploitation of a child two months earlier.\\n\\nHis arrest in 2015 made headlines, but the four cases against him were immediately suppressed until he was sentenced. No other stories were published until after he pleaded guilty, was sentenced, and prosecutors later made a public announcement in June 2016.\\n\\nOne of the four cases against Falk was unsuppressed a month after that, records show — but the other three felony cases for which he was sentenced remained closed. That changed on June 13 after The Post began asking why.\\n\\nThe first-degree murder case in Adams County against juvenile Aidan Zellmer remains suppressed even though a judge has already ruled the 15-year-old is to stand trial as an adult.\\n\\nAnd despite media coverage about the case, the warrant affidavit that describes the evidence that led to Zellmer’s arrest remains suppressed, as well as any other information about the case against him.\\n\\nEven when a defendant has been charged, convicted and sent to prison, if the case is suppressed, some district attorney’s offices still treat it as if the matter has been sealed, even though the two are very different.\\n\\n“The short answer is that suppressed and sealed means the same thing to the extent the public is barred from access,” Denver district attorney’s office spokesman Ken Lane told The Post when asked to provide information about a suppressed case from 2013 in which Denver was the special prosecutor in a different county. “So, if whatever case you’re referring to is in fact suppressed by a court order, then respectfully, I’m not going to violate a court order and release case information to the public.”', 'clickbait': array(['0'], dtype='<U1')}\n",

Kavanaugh said in June 2002 that any such programs “targeting” native Hawaiians “as a group” are “subject to strict scrutiny” and “of questionable validity under the Constitution.” Hirono said in the hearing that her “colleagues from Alaska should be deeply troubled” by the nominee’s views because they would also apply to native Alaskans.

But he faces a major obstacle: A provision of the Florida Constitution with Jim Crow–era roots prevents more than 1.5 million Floridians — a disproportionate number of whom are black — from voting at all.\\n\\nLike three other states, Florida permanently blocks people with felony convictions from voting. But the state’s process for restoring voting rights to people who have served their time is uniquely harsh: Felons can win back their voting rights only by appealing directly to the governor and other state officials. It can take years to win a hearing. Because of this, Florida is home to more disenfranchised felons than any other state. In 2016 the policy blocked more than 10 percent of the voting-age population and more than 20 percent of African-Americans from casting a ballot.\\n\\nBut this fall, organizers see a rare opportunity to overcome that barrier. Voters in November will weigh in on a proposed constitutional amendment to automatically restore voting rights to most people who complete their sentences for felony convictions. (People convicted of murder and sexual offenses would be excluded.) Observers think the proposal could benefit Gillum by encouraging unlikely voters to go to the polls because they know someone disenfranchised because of a felony conviction.\\n\\nGroups supporting the proposal, known as Amendment 4, have emphasized the personal stories of disenfranchised people to motivate people to go to the polls.\\n\\n“We definitely know that family members, friends, colleagues — people who are familiar with the pain somebody else might be going through — are willing to show up and be their voices,” said Neil Volz, the political director for the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, the main group pushing the amendment. “Bloodlines are a really powerful connector, and people who know somebody who’s directly impacted have a real personal reason to get out and vote.” He cannot vote in the state because of a felony conviction.\\n\\nWe definitely know that family members, friends, colleagues – people who are familiar with the pain somebody else might be going through – are willing to show up and be their voices. Neil Volz, political director, Florida Rights Restoration Coalition\\n\\nFlorida’s policy of disenfranchising felons dates back to the state’s first Constitution in 1838 and was reinforced after the Civil War as a way to keep black Americans from the polls.\\n\\nThen-Govs. Charlie Crist (a Republican at the time) and Jeb Bush (R) tweaked the rules to make it easier to get voting rights restored, but Gov. Rick Scott (R) changed the rules when he arrived in office to make it more difficult. Now people have to wait five or seven years, depending on their offense, from the time they complete their sentence to apply to have their voting rights restored. Those convicted of more serious offenses have to appear in person before Scott, who is running for a U.S. Senate seat, and other top state officials and ask for their rights to be restored. The board meets only four times per year, and the backlog is so great that it can take years to get an appearance date.\\n\\nThomas Kennedy, the political director of the Florida immigrant coalition, said it was “very frustrating” to go into communities of color for a campaign and meet people who support a candidate or issue but can’t vote.\\n\\n“We meet people all the time, like when we’re talking to voters, for whatever the campaign, they say, ‘Oh, I actually can’t vote. I’m a felon,’” he said. He added that even though only felons are blocked from voting, people with misdemeanors and other criminal histories who are eligible to vote can be confused and think they’re ineligible.\\n\\nDaniel Smith, a political science professor at the University of Florida, said disenfranchised voters are in a Catch-22 because they can’t participate in the political process until their rights are restored. Still, he predicted the measure would benefit Democratic candidates.\\n\\n“People know that Republicans have made this incredibly difficult,” he said. “It’d be hard to make the case that you support the measure and that you also support the Republican candidate because the Republican candidate for governor is going to oppose this measure, even if it passes.”\\n\\nCarlos Barria / Reuters Gov. Rick Scott (R) changed the rules in Florida to make it more difficult for felons to get their voting rights back. He is running for a U.S. Senate seat this fall.\\n\\nA spokesperson for DeSantis did not return a request for comment on his stance on the amendment. (DeSantis said in January he would “look at it.”) Gillum has said he strongly supports the amendment.\\n\\nSmith pointed to some polling from this year that showed more than 70 percent of Florida voters supported passing the amendment, and he said it was a sign that support for the measure extended beyond Democrats.\\n\\n“There are Republicans and [unaffiliated voters] who are strongly in favor of Amendment 4, and that’s where I think the real interesting dynamic is,” he said. The ballot question, he added, could sway voters to support candidates on the ballot, like Gillum, who support the measure.\\n\\nSteve Schale, a Democratic political operative who ran Barack Obama’s Florida campaign in 2008, said that from a campaign’s perspective, voting restrictions mean spending more money to educate people about what they need to do to cast a ballot. He predicted that enthusiasm for Amendment 4 would help Democrats.\\n\\nVolz said Amendment 4 would have broad support because people understand the larger concept of why it is important to restore voting rights to felons who have served their time.', 'clickbait': array(['0'], dtype='<U1')}\n",

But new polling shows a guaranteed jobs policy is even more popular when the jobs would focus on “scaling up renewable energy, weatherizing homes and office buildings, developing mass transit projects, and maintaining green community spaces” ― even among those who voted for President Donald Trump in 2016.\\n\\nThe survey ― commissioned by the left-leaning think tank Data for Progress and the advocacy group Sunrise Movement and shared with HuffPost ― found 55 percent of eligible American voters support federal funding for guaranteed employment. But the percentage of voters who opposed the policy decreased from 23 percent to 18 percent when those guaranteed jobs are green.\\n\\nTrump voters in particular viewed a green jobs guarantee more favorably, with 35 percent in support and 36 percent opposed. By comparison, just 30 percent of Trump voters supported a guaranteed job without an environmental focus, while 45 percent opposed.\\n\\nMaking the guaranteed jobs green garnered strong support across all regions of the country. In cities, 45 percent of respondents said they supported a green job guarantee, compared to 43 percent who were in favor of a less specific jobs guarantee. In rural districts, 35 percent favored a green job guarantee, while 31 percent supported one for regular jobs. In the suburbs, 33 percent were for green jobs versus 25 percent for a jobs guarantee.\\n\\nThe survey, conducted by the firm YouGov from July 13-16, polled 1,515 eligible voters and is weighted to be nationally representative.\\n\\nThe poll also suggested that campaigning on a green jobs guarantee could help drive voter turnout. Fifty-one percent of eligible voters said they would be more likely to support a candidate running on a green jobs platform, compared to just 20 percent opposed.\\n\\nData for Progress A chart from the Data for Progress report shows support for a green jobs guarantee compared to a \"community\" jobs guarantee broken down by how respondents voted in 2016.\\n\\nForty-eight percent said they would be more likely to vote for a candidate running on a platform of 100 percent renewable energy by 2030. That deadline is more ambitious than the 2035 target mandated in the Off Fossil Fuels for a Better Future Act, the bill Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) proposed last September and the most progressive climate legislation in Congress to date.\\n\\nYoung voters in particular support aggressive climate policies. More than half of voters under 30 said they would be more supportive of a candidate running on renewable energy or green jobs. By comparison, just 15 percent of millennial voters said a 100 percent renewable platform would make them less likely to vote for a candidate, and 10 percent said the same about green jobs.\\n\\nThe findings highlight the extent to which the partisan divide over climate change diminishes when framed outside the increasingly tribalist binary of “belief” in the underlying science. Fifty-seven percent of Americans understand that global warming is mostly caused by humans, according to 2018 polling data from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication.\\n\\n“Progressives can run on green jobs literally anywhere,” said Sean McElwee, the co-founder of Data for Progress. “It’s time to stop looking to the center and look to the movements among young progressives for environmental justice.”\\n\\nThe results also illuminate a path forward for Democrats as the party wrestles with how to deal with a fossil fuel industry that is primarily responsible for anthropogenic global warming.\\n\\nLast month, the Democratic National Committee voted to backtrack on its two-month-old ban on corporate donations from oil, gas and coal companies. The move came at the behest of powerful unions who support lucrative pipeline projects, spotlighting the tension between the Democratic Party’s labor and environmental factions.\\n\\nPipeline construction pays considerably better than renewable energy projects and relies more on organized labor. Welding inspectors averaged nearly $36 per hour, while solar installers earned just over $16, according to data from the salary comparison site PayScale. Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows wind turbine technicians averaged $25.91 per hour last year.\\n\\nIt’s time to stop looking to the center and look to the movements among young progressives for environmental justice. Sean McElwee, Data for Progress co-founder\\n\\nRequiring union wages for federally-backed renewable energy jobs could change that equation.\\n\\nA handful of high-profile Democratic candidates this year are running on a “Green New Deal,” a reference to the 1930s spending programs enacted after the Great Depression that established many of the country’s infrastructure landmarks.\\n\\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the likely next representative for New York’s 14th Congressional District, is calling for “the investment of trillions of dollars and the creation of millions of high-wage jobs.” Rashida Tlaib, the progressive running to replace Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) in Detroit, said she supports a Green New Deal. Randy Bryce, the union ironworker and Democratic nominee in Wisconsin’s 1st Congressional District, vowed to fix “crumbling” infrastructure by investing in federally-backed renewable energy jobs with union pay.

Tom Carper (D-Del.).\\n\\nIn recent weeks, insurgent progressive candidates have had some big wins. In New York, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez knocked off Rep. Joe Crowley, a prospect for speaker of the House. In Florida, Andrew Gillum won a Democratic primary filled with more moderate and better-funded candidates for governor. And in Massachusetts on Tuesday, Ayanna Pressley handily defeated Rep. Mike Capuano, a 10-term incumbent.\\n\\nOn Thursday, progressives have another chance for a big win if they defeat Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.), a business-friendly moderate who has been in office since 2001.\\n\\nCommunity organizer Kerri Evelyn Harris remains a long-shot. The only public poll in the race, conducted in July, showed Carper leading by 32 percentage points.\\n\\nBut left-leaning outsiders have regularly defied polls this election cycle, and election watchers maintain that it is the most competitive primary Carper has faced since he first entered the Senate. The challenge has prompted Carper, whose 2012 primary opponent won just 12 percent of the vote, to spend over $1.5 million on his present primary campaign. As of mid-August, Carper had an additional $1 million in cash on hand to spend against her.\\n\\nThat Harris has even mounted a serious bid against Carper when he has raised at least 25 times as much money as she has speaks to the unexpected strength of her candidacy as well as that of the populist wave sweeping the Democratic Party.\\n\\nThere is no shortage of policy differences between Carper and Harris. They disagree on how to handle the student debt crisis (Carper claims Harris’ plan to cancel student debt would require a “magic wand”), bank regulation (Carper voted for a major rollback of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform bill), climate change (Carper supported the Keystone XL natural gas pipeline) and Medicare for all (Carper does not support it).\\n\\nWhether you’re living in government housing or a truly middle-class neighborhood, we’re all having these issues of trying to make ends meet. Democratic Senate candidate Kerri Evelyn Harris\\n\\nBut a central theme has been a dispute over authenticity and trust, particularly around corporate campaign money ― another issue that played out in Pressley’s win over Capuano, known as a progressive lawmaker, on Tuesday.\\n\\nCarper has received $1.7 million from political action committees representing businesses this year alone. His biggest corporate PAC donors include United Parcel Service, which has contributed $50,000, and the Swiss multinational bank UBS, which has given him $25,000.\\n\\nHarris argues that these donations undermine any promises he makes. If she wins, she will be one of 117 Democratic congressional nominees who have pledged not to accept corporate PAC money, according to End Citizens United, a group that promotes the pledge.\\n\\nDuring an Aug. 27 debate, Carper preemptively defended himself on the issue, an acknowledgment of its importance in the race. He implied that it was incorrect to say that he had taken money from corporations, since corporations are legally required to donate to federal candidates through political action committees rather than directly. (He also highlighted his support for public campaign financing, among other far-reaching reforms.)\\n\\nCarper’s decision to debate Harris shows that he knows he has a race on his hands. He has also filmed a digital video advertisement that emulated the biographical style of many younger candidates and sought the help of former Vice President Joe Biden, a fellow Delawarean, who recorded a robocall on Carper’s behalf.\\n\\nRegardless of the outcome Thursday, the message is clear: If even a three-term senator and former governor of one of the most pro-business states in the country is vulnerable to a left-wing challenge, no elected Democrat is safe.\\n\\n“For far too long, Democratic politicians have thought that, so long as they are not involved in a tawdry scandal, they could count on renomination. That’s a very anti-democratic worldview,” said Jeff Hauser, executive director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research’s Revolving Door Project. “It is incredibly good for democracy that politicians have to face their voters and justify their actions in the name of those voters.”\\n\\nMark Makela for The Washington Post via Getty Images Democratic primary candidate Kerri Evelyn Harris, a gay Air Force veteran, greets a supporter in Wilmington, Delaware, on July 20.\\n\\nA Community Organizer Who Knows What It’s Like To Struggle\\n\\nHarris, 38, the daughter of a white mother and a black father, both schoolteachers, is a recently divorced gay woman who left her Air Force career in 2008 when a bad reaction to an anthrax vaccine permanently sidelined her.\\n\\nHarris has struggled to provide for her two children, now ages 8 and 1, taking jobs as a cook at a gas station and as an auto mechanic. In a June interview with HuffPost, Harris recounted the ongoing challenge of making ends meet ― let alone campaigning ― on a modest income. She said she remembered the pain she felt over the years turning down her daughter’s requests to buy simple things. Her daughter would offer to pay for things herself with money from her piggy bank.\\n\\nHarris held back tears as she recalled the “personal disappointment in yourself because you should never have to put your kid in that situation where they feel like they have to assist you.”\\n\\nAlthough Harris is still completing her bachelor’s degree, she now has steady work as an organizer in Wilmington. She leads the Achievement Matters program to lower the educational achievement gap between different parts of Delaware’s biggest city, and she helps low-income families address their needs through her work with the Delaware Alliance for Community Advancement.\\n\\nHarris sees her biracial heritage, military service and personal experience with economic scarcity as the sort of diverse perspective that makes her a natural organizer. Even her stint at a predominantly white auto body shop helped her speak to reluctant audiences about building working-class solidarity, according to Harris.\\n\\n“Whether you’re living in government housing or a truly middle-class neighborhood, we’re all having these issues of trying to make ends meet and these pains of having the whole family chip in,” she said. “And it’s not getting better. So we have to make it better.”\\n\\nMario Tama/Getty Images The June primary win of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, seen here speaking at a fundraiser in Los Angeles, gave Harris' campaign new life. Ocasio-Cortez has since rallied for Harris.\\n\\nAn Ocasio-Cortez Repeat?\\n\\nHarris toiled in obscurity for months until the stunning June primary win of Ocasio-Cortez, who is now the Democratic nominee in New York’s 14th Congressional District.\\n\\nHarris and her staff drove up to Queens to help get out the vote for Ocasio-Cortez on June 26. Ocasio-Cortez returned the favor with a shout-out to her massive Twitter following, and money and national attention soon poured into Harris’ fledgling campaign.\\n\\nShe raked in $15,000 in the week after Ocasio-Cortez’s win ― more than she had raised in the four months prior.\\n\\nThe ties between the two campaigns have grown even stronger in recent weeks. Key members of the Justice Democrats, the group of Bernie Sanders campaign alumni who effectively ran Ocasio-Cortez’s bid, have taken up camp in Delaware to spearhead Harris’ digital and field organizing operations. And in late August, Ocasio-Cortez came down to headline rallies for Harris in Newark and Wilmington.\\n\\nThere are undoubtedly parallels between the two candidates. Both are political newcomers and women of color who challenged significantly older and better-funded white male incumbents with track records of coziness with big business.\\n\\nNBC’s Chuck Todd made the comparison explicit in an “MTP Daily” segment last Friday. After rattling off a number of Harris’ policy positions and criticisms of Carper, Todd quipped, “Sound familiar?” Images of Ocasio-Cortez and Harris campaigning together appeared on screen as he spoke.\\n\\nMEET THE MIDTERMS: There could be one more major primary upset this midterm season as Kerri Harris takes on Sen.

He has a more centrist record on fiscal and economic policy.\\n\\nA New ‘Delaware Way’?\\n\\nHarris’ campaign ― and her juxtaposition with Carper, a 71-year-old former Naval officer ― have a distinctly Delawarean flavor.\\n\\nFor several decades, members of Delaware’s congressional delegation ― from either party ― have been characterized by a liberal bent on so-called social issues, such as abortion and LGBTQ rights, and a more centrist approach to fiscal issues, such as taxes and regulation. Delaware has evolved into a tax and regulatory haven, making it a hub for some of the country’s largest financial institutions and pharmaceutical companies, alongside historic industries like chemical manufacturing.\\n\\nThe state’s political class refers to this bipartisan spirit of cooperation with industry as the “Delaware Way.”\\n\\nIn four decades in state politics, Carper has embodied this style of governance more than many others ― in some cases pioneering it, as The Intercept documented in detail.\\n\\nAs Delaware’s sole congressman in 1987, Carper helped kill a cap on credit card interest rates. In 1998, as Delaware’s governor, Carper abolished the state’s inheritance tax. And in 2005, as a senator, Carper co-sponsored then-President George W. Bush’s bankruptcy reform bill, which made it harder for struggling families to write off their debts. Unlike then-Delaware Sen. Joe Biden, who has also endured criticism for backing the legislation, Carper rejected most amendments that tried to make the bill fairer.\\n\\nUntil now, the conventional wisdom was that this was the kind of balance Delaware voters wanted, the kind that was right for a state so dependent on its attractiveness to major corporations.\\n\\nIndeed, Carper defends his record as a reflection of the state’s pragmatic, business-friendly brand of liberalism. Unlike the most conservative Democratic members of Congress, Carper was a reliable vote for the biggest Democratic priorities, such as the Affordable Care Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law, which he proudly boasts of helping write. (In March, Carper justified his support for the repeal of some of Dodd-Frank’s key oversight provisions for banks with under $250 billion in assets on the grounds that Delaware’s community banks and credit unions needed relief.)\\n\\nCarper, who is the ranking member on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, also frames his penchant for bipartisan deal-making as an advantage in the consensus-oriented Senate. His behind-the-scenes persuasion efforts with Republican colleagues reportedly played a role in the White House’s withdrawal of Kathleen Hartnett White, a climate change skeptic, as nominee to head the Environmental Protection Agency’s Council on Environmental Quality, and Michael Dourson, a pro-industry researcher, as head of the EPA’s chemical safety division.\\n\\n“It’s one thing to know the right thing to do; it’s another thing to actually do it,” he said in the Aug. 27 debate.\\n\\nIt’s one thing to know the right thing to do; it’s another thing to actually do it. Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.)\\n\\nAnd, unlike New York’s Crowley, whose primary residence was in Northern Virginia, Carper commutes to and from his Delaware home every day. His biographical digital campaign ad depicts him heading to the Wilmington YMCA every morning before he takes the Amtrak to Washington. The minute-long video also features endorsements from the head of the state’s teachers union, the state’s former health secretary and Wilmington port workers.\\n\\n“I get my energy from the people I serve,” Carper says. The camera then shows him getting behind the wheel of his old Chrysler minivan, which he boasts has 482,000 miles on it.\\n\\nBut 2018 is a year of high enthusiasm among Democratic activists. For Resistance voters fired up about President Donald Trump, Carper’s votes in support of Trump administration officials may be even more of a liability than his record of standing up for the big banks. He voted to confirm Energy Secretary Rick Perry as well as Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, among other Trump Cabinet officials. And perhaps most damaging, in 2006, he voted to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the federal bench (he has said he regrets that vote and plans to vote against Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court confirmation).\\n\\nHarris believes that there is another Delaware that has not always been represented by the state’s Democratic members of Congress. She plans to win in large part by turning out many of the progressives, voters of color and working-class people who often stay home in midterm elections. Wilmington is a particularly target-rich environment for this approach: 58 percent of city residents are black; 26 percent live in poverty.\\n\\nThe Working Families Party, which is trying to move the Democratic Party to the left, has invested $100,000 to help turn out those voters. The group’s spending will include text-message alerts, digital advertisements, direct mail and paid field organizing.\\n\\nRecent poll-defying primary wins by two underdog black candidates ― Gillum, the Democratic nominee for governor of Florida, and Pressley, the uncontested Democratic nominee in Massachusetts’ 7th Congressional District ― lend greater plausibility to Harris’ strategy. And if Delaware’s typically low midterm primary turnout grows significantly this year, Harris’ advisers believe that she still needs just 26,000 of those votes to win.\", 'clickbait': array(['0'], dtype='<U1')}\n",

That throws the scent off me,” one White House official told Axios earlier this year.\\n\\nOf course, the key piece of evidence suggesting that Pence is not the author may be his own fawning, obsequious praise of Trump.\\n\\nHowever, it should also be noted that Scott Roos, a former college classmate of Pence’s, said the future vice president once said that “God told him he would be president,” according to CNN.\\n\\nTheoretically, he could have written the op-ed to jump-start the dream.', 'clickbait': array(['1'], dtype='<U1')}\n",

Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N.Y.) had been raising funds for his re-election to the U.S. House but later decided to run for attorney general of New York. His district just north of New York City went for Donald Trump in 2016.\\n\\nZephyr Teachout filed a lawsuit on Thursday accusing Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N.Y.) of violating state campaign finance law by misusing over $1.4 million raised by his congressional campaign in a bid to become New York’s attorney general.\\n\\nWith support from big banks, real estate developers and corporate law firms, Maloney has collected more than $3 million to run for re-election to Congress, where he represents a swing district that narrowly went for Donald Trump in 2016. But in June, Maloney jumped into the race to succeed disgraced New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman ― while still running to keep his House seat. According to his New York state campaign finance disclosure form, Maloney moved $425,000 from his federal congressional campaign account into a the state campaign on Aug. 10, and $1 million more on Aug. 23.\\n\\nAccording to the lawsuit, those cash infusions are a gross violation of the $21,100 contribution limit in the attorney general primary. Because Maloney’s federal campaign did not register as a political committee with the state of New York, it has avoided state disclosure rules and state campaign contribution limits. Allowing Maloney’s congressional campaign to funnel unlimited sums into the AG race would thus open up a new loophole for candidates seeking to circumvent state campaign finance rules.\\n\\n“Political contributions do not become the personal funds of the candidate to be used simply as the candidate dictates,” the lawsuit reads. “Federal campaign committees do not have the special privilege of making unlimited transfers to a political committee that is regulated under state law.”\\n\\nThe law firm of Ali Najmi filed a separate, similar complaint against Maloney with the New York State Board of Elections on Aug. 28.\\n\\nTeachout, a Fordham University law professor, has emerged as unlikely front-runner in the New York AG race after winning the endorsements of both The New York Times and the New York Daily News. The contest has taken on national significance as the Democratic Party seeks to reorganize itself in the aftermath of a devastating 2016 election. New York politics are notoriously corrupt ― two top aides to Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) have been convicted on corruption charges this year ― and a resurgent Democratic Party left has rallied behind Teachout ― author of an academic book on anti-corruption law ― as a potential corrective to the current administrations in Albany and Washington D.C. New York City Public Advocate Letitia James is also a contender, but Maloney’s war chest has bolstered his name recognition among voters.\\n\\nIn August, a New York court approved Maloney’s unusual dual run for the U.S. House and attorney general on the grounds that Maloney would drop out of the House race if he won the state AG primary. Democrats would have six weeks to name a replacement candidate, a situation which has Republicans eyeing his House seat as a rare pickup opportunity in a midterm election where Democrats clearly have the momentum.\\n\\nAs a member of Congress, Maloney has cultivated a moderate record. But he has distanced himself from the moderate label in the attorney general race as the Democratic Party’s progressive wing has flexed its muscles in 2018, most vividly in the recent primary upset victory for Democratic Socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York. Maloney has repeatedly voted to deregulate big banks and supported a recent successful effort to unwind parts of President Barack Obama’s 2010 financial reform law. He has also voted to increase Trump’s military budget and expand the president’s warrantless surveillance powers. In 2015, Maloney was one of just four House Democrats who voted to prohibit undocumented immigrants from receiving federal housing assistance.\\n\\nAccording to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, top donors to Maloney’s congressional campaign include employees of Wall Street heavyweights Goldman Sachs, New York Life Insurance and Bloomberg, along with two real estate developers ensnared in recent New York scandals.\\n\\nFetner Properties secured a sweetheart deal from the New York City Housing Authority last year, to build a 330-apartment high-rise, after Fetner donated heavily to the campaigns of New York Mayor Bill de Blasio. Fetner employees are the 10th-largest contributor to Maloney’s congressional campaign, shelling out $13,490 in the 2018 campaign cycle.\\n\\nMaloney has also received $27,000 from employees of Simon Property Group, which paid $945,000 to settle an antitrust suit from Schneiderman’s office last year.', 'clickbait': array(['0'], dtype='<U1')}\n",

The United States has since 2015 provided the Saudis and Emiratis with weapons, aerial refueling, intelligence and diplomatic backing as they have fought a rebel Yemeni militia called the Houthis that has received Iranian support and committed widespread human rights abuses of its own.\\n\\n“The people of Yemen face the world’s largest humanitarian catastrophe where 22 million people require humanitarian assistance and almost 18 million lack access to food,” Rep. Khanna said in the Thursday statement. “It’s critical that the United States not choose sides in this war, and any American involvement can and must be debated transparently.”\\n\\nThe congressional play is a long shot. Opponents of the measure, particularly House Republican leadership, could argue it does not deserve “privileged” status, as they did when Khanna, Pocan and two GOP members introduced a similar bill last fall. Back then, they removed the privilege and crafted a replacement compromise bill after negotiations with the proposal’s backers, who felt discouraged but noted they at least forced the House to acknowledge U.S. culpability in the devastating conflict. The war went on, and months later a similar high-profile attempt to end the U.S. role in the war narrowly failed in the Senate.\\n\\nNow, some lawmakers and experts believe renewed public pressure has a shot at encouraging peace even if it does not ultimately force an up-or-down vote on the policy. The United Nations on Friday hopes to convene the first talks between the warring sides in two years and the Trump administration faces a congressionally-mandated Sept. 12 deadline to certify that the Saudis, Emiratis and allied Yemenis deserve American support because they are truly trying to end the fighting.\\n\\n“Hopefully this will send a message to those parties involved in those negotiations that Congress is watching,” a House aide said. The aide noted that the bill has more prominent supporters than last year’s privileged resolution. That proposal eventually gained 53 co-sponsors.\\n\\nEven as U.S. officials have said assistance to the coalition is essential to ensure it follows international law, attacks like the high-profile strike last month have added to widespread Washington skepticism about that years-old argument.\\n\\n“For a lot of people, the [August] strike was the last straw,” the aide continued.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, Oxfam reported that August had been the deadliest month in 2018 for civilians in Yemen.

He says the dances have given him something to look forward to since the death of his wife earlier this year.\\n\\n“I’m much happier,” he told HuffPost. “It gives me something to do other than sit around all day.”\\n\\nThe dances are just one of the activities coordinated by Progressive Attention Network for Integral Elder Care, a program created by the country’s Health Ministry in 2010 to help elderly people stay active and socially engaged. Though the network spans Costa Rica, it is particularly robust on Nicoya, a peninsula on the country’s Pacific coast that is among five world regions known as blue zones, where people live the longest.\\n\\nThe reasons for Nicoyans’ longevity are not fully understood, but researchers from National Geographic identified high levels of spirituality, a strong cultural base and close social relationships as ingredients in the peninsula’s recipe for a long life. Dr. Zinnia Cordero, director of the Health Ministry in Nicoya, said programs like the care network allow the ministry to help foster these less-tangible health benefits among the area’s elderly population.\\n\\n“It’s about helping people maintain the desire to keep living,” Cordero said. “Protecting these health factors isn’t only a priority of individuals, it’s a priority of the government.”\\n\\nMonica Quesada for HuffPost Meeting at the Health Ministry of Nicoya. Doctor Zinnia Cordero (center) director of the Health Ministry in Nicoya, Guanacaste, Costa Rica.\\n\\nThe well-being of seniors is now seen as so important that newly elected Costa Rican President Carlos Alvarado declared the betterment of the lives of the elderly as a political priority. Last month, during a tour of Nicoya, Alvarado met with Gómez and 14 other older Nicoyans to discuss how the government can do more to improve their lives.\\n\\nAlvarado, who took office in May, comes from a long line of Costa Rican leaders who have made the well-being of citizens a government imperative. Since the mid-20th century, Costa Rica has had public health care to which all Costa Ricans have access, along with free and compulsory primary and secondary education. It is the only country in Central America where 100 percent of the population has access to electricity.\\n\\nThis government strategy seems to have paid off, and Costa Rica continuously ranks as one of the happiest places on earth. In the 2018 Gallup World Poll ― a standard for measuring self-reported happiness ― people all over the world were asked to rank their life satisfaction from 0 to 10. Costa Rica’s average score was 7.07 ― 13th in the world and the highest in Latin America.\\n\\nMonica Quesada for HuffPost Rice field outside Nicoya, Guanacaste, Costa Rica\\n\\nThe countries at the top of the happiness scale are relatively wealthy; Costa Rica is a notable exception. It has the highest levels of self-reported well-being of any middle-income country, and carries more happiness per GDP dollar. The country’s GDP per capita is $11,630, compared with $59,531 in the U.S., which lags behind Costa Rica in happiness.\\n\\n“Costa Rica tells us that there is something beyond money that is important,” said Mariano Rojas, a happiness expert from Costa Rica and an economics professor at the Latin American Social Sciences Institute. “There is a difference between the quantity of money you have and the way you use it. There is a way to spend money that contributes to the happiness of the people.”\\n\\nIn 1948, Costa Rica abolished its military, rededicating its defense budget to education, health and pensions. Even as new administrations have come and gone, this basic budgeting tenet has remained intact. In 2016, Costa Rica spent more on education as a proportion of GDP than any country except one, according to data from the World Bank.\\n\\nThe country has a life expectancy of 81, according to the Costa Rican Health Ministry (The World Health Organization put it at around 79.6 in 2016). This is higher than some wealthy countries such as the U.S., for example, which has a life expectancy of 78.6 and has seen a decline over the last two years.\\n\\n“Our high life expectancy is a reflection of the decisions we’ve made as a country,” Cordero said. “Through our social security administration, we were able to strengthen health care for our entire population, regardless of their social or economic condition.”\\n\\nMonica Quesada for HuffPost La Anexión Hospital in Nicoya, Guanacaste, Costa Rica. It belongs to the social security system\\n\\nCosta Ricans in even the most rural parts of the country have access to preventive and emergency care through an extensive system of health clinics. Because even the poorest Costa Ricans can access these primary care clinics, one 2016 study found that Costa Ricans lower on the socioeconomic scale had a significantly lower mortality rate than people of similar status in the U.S.\\n\\nThough Costa Rica has a high level of wealth inequality, universal access to social services means that Costa Ricans tend not to experience unequal treatment in other areas of their lives, especially health care.\\n\\n“The money you have does not make a difference in how people treat you,” Rojas said. “This is interesting because it implies that there is no status race like in other countries, where you may need to buy a larger house or a nicer car in order to gain status.”\\n\\nInstead, Costa Ricans put more value on personal relationships than almost any other culture, Rojas said. Costa Ricans tend to spend more time with their families than people in other countries, she said, and in the Gallup World Poll, more than 85 percent of Costa Ricans reported feeling love and affection every day.\\n\\nBut not every aspect of happiness can be measured. Many Costa Ricans use the phrase pura vida to talk about what makes life so satisfying. The idiom literally translates to pure life, but refers to the laid-back and peaceful lifestyle that Costa Rica has become known for.\\n\\nWhen asked what about the senior dances is so gratifying, Gómez laughs, then answered: “Es muy ‘pura vida.’”\\n\\nMonica Quesada for HuffPost Francisco Gomez shows some of his dance moves.', 'clickbait': array(['1'], dtype='<U1')}\n",

I’ve been working at HuffPost ― where I commission and edit personal stories from writers ― for nearly five years, and I wasn’t sure what this impulsive buy meant for my job, or what it would mean for planning my upcoming wedding in April. When I bought the flight, the only thing that mattered was that I knew I felt comfortable eating the cost if I ended up changing my mind.\\n\\nWhen I told my fiancé about my impulsive choice, he immediately replied with, “Oh, thank God, you’re finally doing it!” He was genuinely happy I was finally taking action toward the dream I’d been talking about for so long: to travel long-term.\\n\\nYou see, if you know me, the nomadic lifestyle I crave isn’t that crazy. I grew up in a family of travelers. As a child of immigrants, I spent most of my childhood summers abroad visiting extended families I’d only get to see once a year ― Japan with my mom’s family and India with my dad’s. My older brother studied abroad in multiple countries and hoards language skills the way most of us hoard free T-shirts. My older sister quit her job in New York City at 26 to move to Argentina, where she lived for about six months before coming home. Curiosity for the world and other cultures runs through my veins.\\n\\nWhen my college sweetheart and I broke up in 2014 after a complicated 4 1/2-year relationship, I knew I needed to do something to change my life. Some people cut their hair and change their appearance; I booked a 2 1/2 week trip to Croatia and Iceland by myself. Extreme? Yes. Terrifying and lonely? Definitely. Totally worth it? Absolutely.\\n\\nSahaj Kohli The author glacier climbing in Iceland.\\n\\nSince then, I’ve been on a solo trip at least once a year to six different countries. I have always used all of my vacation and personal days for these trips (and others), but it’s never felt like enough.\\n\\nThis isn’t the first time I’ve considered traveling while working. After an inspiring two-week trip to Portugal in 2016, I almost had an approved plan with work to travel for nine months, but another opportunity at HuffPost came up. I was at a crossroads: Stay and get promoted or leave to travel and live out a dream of mine.\\n\\nI chose responsibility, but over the last two years, my dreams only became more apparent. I continuously felt stifled by complacency. Though I’d try to have trips planned to break up the monotony of my routine, I only came back from them feeling worse than before. I couldn’t stop wondering if I made the wrong choice by choosing to stay in New York. But as most things fall into place when you least expect it, I met, fell in love with and got engaged to a partner during the time between making that choice and finally pursuing that dream today.\\n\\nLife doesn’t create perfect times for everything. There will be times you won’t get what you think you need and something entirely different will fall into place. Sometimes you’ll get two things at once and have to choose. Other times you’ll get what you want and it won’t be at all how you thought it would be.\\n\\nAfter five years, my life is settled in New York. And between planning a wedding and potentially applying to graduate schools, now’s not the best time to jet off around the world ... but it’s the right time, because the opportunity is still plausible. I’m not yet starting a family, and I am my only financial responsibility at this time. I’m healthy ― as are the people I love ― and my job allows me the flexibility (especially since I’ve proven to be self-motivated and dependable). And my lease was up on Aug. 31.\\n\\nI ended up canceling that trip to Hawaii (and got a refund!) last month, but Tuesday, I left the life I built in New York City, my partner and my routine office life to travel long-term. While I usually opt for a loose plan, this time around I’m creating a remote lifestyle with enough structure for work but necessary room for spontaneity and play. I’ll be working from cafes, Airbnbs and hostels, checking in with my boss weekly and continuing to recruit writers with great stories — but rather than scouring the internet for them, I’m hoping to find them organically through exploring creative spaces, talking to locals and with the help of your recommendations.\\n\\nSamuel Hall The author and her fiancé.\\n\\nBefore you get excited for me and recognize that I’ve made a dream come true, I know what you’re thinking: What about my fiancé, Sam? Most people react first to my decision to be away from him in the months leading up to our wedding: How commendable it is that he’s letting me go. How shocking it is that I’d leave my partner behind.\\n\\nSam has known about my travel goals since I met him two years ago. He wouldn’t have truly fallen in love with me if he didn’t support and accept my wandering soul. And I would have never fallen for him either. It’s really, really that simple.\\n\\nHe wants to join me so badly, and maybe down the road he’ll be able to. But he’s focused on his career right now and has an amazing job. I am so proud of him, but I haven’t stopped dreaming just because I have a life partner.\\n\\nHe isn’t letting me go. He’s standing fiercely behind my dreams the same way I would do for him. And truthfully, I have second-guessed this adventure more times than I’d like to admit. Sam hasn’t wavered, reminding me that this is something I need to do and it’ll be good for us. He tells me often that by living out my truths, I inspire him to do the same.\\n\\nOf course I’ll miss him tremendously, but I’d miss out on so much more if I didn’t do this for myself. And thankfully, with pre-planned trips and the holidays, we’ll still see each other at least once a month ― the longest time apart being about five weeks.\\n\\nSam hasn't wavered, reminding me that this is something I need to do and it'll be good for us. He tells me often that by living out my truths, I inspire him to do the same.\\n\\nI’m so excited and overwhelmed and scared for my adventure, but I know that I have been building up to this moment for at least the past two years since that Portugal trip. I have a Google Maps app with more than 100 specific places saved that I want to see around the world, an Instagram feed strictly of travel, and savings to go with and come back to.\\n\\nI know that I’ll miss not having a home, but I also know that I’ve felt stifled by routine. When you’re a traveler, home is a number of places and in the heart of the relationships you make along the way. For the past couple of years, my work-from-home Thursdays have been the highlight of my workweek. Now, I get to experience that every day, learning how to build my own kind of routine in new places along the way. And, let’s be honest, working remotely actually makes me work harder both because I want to prove that I take my job seriously and because I won’t have the distractions of office culture. I realize this is a privilege not everyone has, but it’s one I’m grateful for.\\n\\nI’ve spent five years helping other people share their unique experiences and inspiring stories, and while I’ll continue to do that, I’m excited to go out and create my own too. Along the way, I hope to meet people I can commission stories from, experience new creative spaces and learn about new communities and cultures.\\n\\nI hope you’ll follow along and help me on this journey. As someone who can be extremely indecisive, I’ll definitely need your help along the way ― whether it’s people to write about, food to try, or natural wonders to see, I’m all ears.\\n\\nI’m currently spending the next week or so in Toronto, Montreal and Ottawa. While this leg of the trip was initially planned as a way to spend quality time with a cousin I rarely get to see, I’m hoping to connect with some other badass Indian women — Rupi Kaur, you free? Holler with any kind of recommendations, and stay tuned for more.\", 'clickbait': array(['1'], dtype='<U1')}\n",

Officials said children couldn’t be in criminal custody with their parents, and were limited in how long they could detain families because of the agreement.\\n\\nThe government currently has three operational family detention centers, but most are at capacity.\\n\\nHowever, Homeland Security asked for space to house 12,000 beds for families, plus space to house 20,000 unaccompanied minors. That process is moving forward; the Defense Department has completed legal and environmental requirements needed but they’re still working on the legal framework for the use of Fort Bliss, in El Paso, Texas for immigrant families. The Department of Health and Human Services, which manages unaccompanied children crossing illegally, has not yet formally requested space for the minors, which it must do in order to set up the use.\\n\\nThe rules proposed Thursday would allow the government to hold families until their immigration cases were completed, a move that government officials contend makes cases go much faster than if families are released.\\n\\nSecretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen speaks to George Washington University's Center for Cyber and Homeland Security, in Washington, Wednesday, Sept. 5, 2018. The Trump administration is planning to circumvent a longstanding court agreement on how children are treated in immigration custody. That means families will be kept in detention longer. Homeland Security announced Thursday it would terminate the agreement which requires the release of immigrant children generally after 20 days. It would instead adopt regulations that administration officials say will provide care of minors, but allow changes to deter migrants illegally crossing the border.

USA TODAY\\n\\nNew York City firefighters work in the burning rubble as they search for victims at ground zero on Sept. 12, 2001. (Photo: Frank Becerra Jr./The Journal News)\\n\\nWHITE PLAINS, N.Y. – Seventeen years out from the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, nearly 10,000 first responders and others who were in the World Trade Center area have been diagnosed with cancer. More than 2,000 deaths have been attributed to 9/11 illnesses.\\n\\nIt will get worse. By the end of 2018, many expect that more people will have died from their toxic exposure from 9/11 than were killed on that terrible Tuesday.\\n\\n“We’re nervous,” said Dr. Michael Crane, medical director of the World Trade Center Health Program Clinical Center of Excellence at Mount Sinai.\\n\\nRobert Reeg of Stony Point, New York, knows the feeling. The retired Fire Department of New York firefighter was seriously injured in the South Tower collapse. In the last 17 years, he\\'s seen fellow first responders who survived the attacks fall victim to the illnesses caused by the contaminants that were spewed all over.\\n\\nJuly 26: Man\\'s remains identified as 9/11 victim using DNA test nearly 17 years after terror attack\\n\\nMay 26: FBI says agent exposed to toxins from 9/11 has died\\n\\n\"You lose track, there\\'s so many of them,\" the 66-year-old said. As for his own health risks, given the growing incidents of cancer among 9/11 first responders, Reeg said he doesn\\'t dwell on it. \"It\\'s at the back of your mind. But you can\\'t let it control you.\"\\n\\nThe average age of a 9/11 first responder is now about 55. While many people face a cancer diagnosis as they age, the rate of some cancers among first responders is up to 30 percent higher than in the general population, Crane said.\\n\\nThe numbers demonstrate the continued loss:\\n\\nIn 2017, 23 current or former members of the New York City Police Department died of 9/11-related diseases. That\\'s the same number of NYPD members that perished on Sept. 11, 2001.\\n\\nThe FDNY lost a stunning 343 members on Sept. 11, 2001. Since then, line-of-duty deaths linked to 9/11 are approaching 180, now well over half lost on the day of the attacks. So many have died since the attacks that last year, a new tablet had to be added to the Hall of Heroes at 1 Police Plaza to accommodate all the names of the fallen.\\n\\nOne FBI agent was reported killed in Sept. 11, 2001, attacks; as of this August, the FBI reports a death toll of 15 from cancers linked to toxic exposure during the subsequent investigation and cleanup.\\n\\nAccording to John Feal, founder of the Feal Good Foundation that supports 9/11 rescue and recovery workers,there have been more losses so far this year – 163 – than in any year since he started tabulating them in 2008.\\n\\nThe twisted silhouette of World Trade Center buildings loom above rescue workers at ground zero on Sept. 13, 2001. (Photo: The Journal News)\\n\\nNew Rochelle Fire Department Capt. Barry Nechis spent a month at Pier 94 working on logistics during the recovery effort. He worries about the range of exposure, from those who worked on The Pile, to the people who sifted through debris at Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island, to the mechanics who worked on dust-laden trucks after they returned to communities that stepped up during the national crisis.\\n\\n\"Oh, it\\'s not going to end,\" he said. Nechis is registered with the WTC Health Program and said he is \"just being monitored.\"\\n\\nSo many risks\\n\\nSpecialists in occupational health like Crane can usually calculate what risks a worker faces in a standard workplace setting, depending on chemical exposure. “9/11 was the opposite,” he said during an Aug. 26 interview. “Steel melting, every time (rescue and recovery workers) moved something, a puff of smoke. They didn’t know what they were dealing with, didn’t have the sort of adequate equipment to protect themselves.”\\n\\nMarch 19: Ferry captain who evacuated hundreds on 9/11 dies of cancer at 45\\n\\nSeptember 2017: N.J. firm fined for allegedly scamming NFL vets, 9/11 first responder\\n\\nSome 90,000 people have reported exposure to toxic chemicals — asbestos, burning jet fuel, burning computer parts, pulverized concrete and myriad other substances. “No one has ever codified or captured all the stuff that was released from that pile,” Crane said. “It’s an unknown exposure.”\\n\\nA memorial name plate for FDNY Lt. Joseph Stach is seen on the side of a historical FDNY engine at St. Ann\\'s Church in Nyack, New York, on Jan. 12, 2018. Stach died from his battle with 9/11-related pancreatic cancer. He retired from the FDNY in 2010 and was also a Life Member of the Empire Hook & Ladder Co. #1 in Upper Nyack. (Photo: Mark Vergari/The Journal News)\\n\\n“I worry about everything. I literally worry about everything,” Crane said.\\n\\nThere\\'s been a somewhat expected progression in the kinds of disease seen among first responders. At first, Crane said, people suffered from irritative diseases such as asthma. \"You were breathing the air, you were eating the particles.\"\\n\\nIt takes years, sometimes decades, for cancers to develop from environmental exposures. \"We believe that is what’s happening now,\" Crane said.\\n\\nSeptember 2017: Hauling Ground Zero debris, a trucker never forgot the 9/11 letter a kid tucked into his glove\\n\\nAugust 2017: New 9/11 victim identified, nearly 16 years later\\n\\nMany are sick for years; for others, it comes on fast.\\n\\nReeg recalled the loss of Jimmy Lanza, an FDNY member who helped pull 16 people out of the rubble from a collapsed stairwell on Sept. 11. Lanza, who led myriad charity efforts, was diagnosed with brain cancer in November 2016; he died in April 2017 at age 71.\\n\\nGone so quickly from 9/11, so long after 9/11.\\n\\nPolice stand at attention as the hearse of Yonkers Police Lt.. Roy McLaughlin, 38, passes by after his September funeral. McLaughlin had helped rescue efforts at ground zero after 9/11 and his death, from cancer, was attributed to his work there. (Photo: Joe Larese/The Journal News)\\n\\nThe wide-ranging latency for cancers – the period between the exposure to a carcinogen and the diagnosis of cancer – adds to confusion in predicting what will happen, when, to an aging first-responder population.\\n\\nSignificantly higher rates of blood cancers, and now kidney cancer, are being diagnosed among first responders. When will the tide turn?\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think we have reached 15 percent of the cancer we\\'re going to see,\" said Dr. Ray Basri, an internist and Middletown, New York, volunteer firefighter who is also a professor of medicine at New York Medical College in Valhalla. \"I really do think we\\'re in the very early stages.\"\\n\\nFinding the cancer link\\n\\nAs first responders sought help for respiratory diseases and other illnesses in the first few years after 9/11, the general consensus was that their exposure at ground zero was a possible factor, but not a clear determinant.\\n\\nBasri, who was the first physician at the scene of the South Tower collapse, said that a 2-inch-thick \"moon dust\"covered the area. As the rescue and then recovery continued, that toxic dust was stirred up with every move. \"The number of people exposed was huge.\"\\n\\nSeptember 2017: An oasis of kindness on 9/11: This town welcomed 6,700 strangers amid terror attacks\\n\\nSeptember 2016: 10 things you may have forgotten about 9/11\\n\\nIt took a class-action suit, by White Plains attorney David Worby, to fill in the blanks about possible cancer risks from the ground zero cleanup. Worby started doing his own research when he couldn\\'t find any.\\n\\n\"I went and wrote the medical paper with only Google support because no doctor was saying these guys had pre-existing exposures,\" Worby said in a 2016 interview. He said few bought into his theory at the time.\\n\\nFDNY Lt. Harry Wanamaker of Upper Nyack, New York, left, with Welles Crowther in front of the World Trade Center on June 20, 2001. Crowther died Sept. 11, 2001. Wanamaker, who worked on the rescue and recovery at ground zero, died in 2010. (Photo: SUBMITTED/Crowther family)\\n\\nThe skepticism back then was significant enough to stall the passage of the James Zadroga 9/11 Health And Compensation Act, initially introduced in 2006, until 2010. The legislation, which re-established a Victims Compensation Fund and set up health-care and health-tracking programs, first focused on respiratory ailments suffered by responders. By 2013, some 50 cancers were included in Zadroga coverage. In 2015, amid a new awareness of the ongoing health crisis facing first responders, the bill was extended through 2090.\\n\\nBasri, who went back to ground zero on Sept. 13, 2001, said he decontaminated himself afterward. But others dragged that dust home. \"It\\'s plausible that there could be an extension to (other) people as well.\"\\n\\nFuture treatment\\n\\nMedical studies are now finding information that could help shape future treatment. A recent study of FDNY members found precursors to multiple myeloma.\\n\\nCrane said that health centers like the Mount Sinai program can offer more frequent screenings for things like lung, cervical and colon cancers for first responders, now that they better understand the risks. Radiologists can look for early markers of a tumor and track those cases closely. \"We\\'ll have guys with exposure come back earlier,\" Crane said.\\n\\nThe Mount Sinai WTC Program has been working with major cancer centers to develop testing protocols that better fit people at risk because of their environmental exposure. But, Crane said, doctors need \"to balance early detection and over-diagnosis of disease.\"\\n\\nThe research among first responders also will impact cancer treatment in general. \"The science of it is still developing,\" Crane said.\\n\\nFollow Nancy Cutler on Twitter: @nancyrockland\\n\\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2MURW4O', 'clickbait': array(['1'], dtype='<U1')}\n",

(Photo: Jack Gruber, USA TODAY)\\n\\nThe U.S. high school graduation rate rose last year, a sign education systems across the country are finding greater success in preparing children for the future. Finishing school is just one indication of the quality of a child’s upbringing. Early education, health and safety are crucial to providing children with the best chance to become healthy, productive adults.\\n\\nWhen choosing where to raise their children, parents look at factors like these. However, some parts of the country struggle to provide a good environment for childhood development. Children in areas with high crime rates, low graduation rates, and low preschool enrollment rates are more likely to struggle later in life in their work and health.\\n\\n24/7 Wall Street reviewed a number of educational, health, and safety measures to determine the worst cities to raise children in the United States. Our index included preschool enrollment figures and high school graduation rates, which each are meant to serve as a proxy for the quality of education in the area. Also included in the index were access to areas for physical activity, as well as violent crime rates.\\n\\nWhile measures of income were not part of our index, many of the worst cities to raise children have low incomes, a factor which often corresponds with the factors we measured, such as violent crime and poor educational outcomes.\\n\\nTwo parts of the U.S. have a much greater share of struggling metro areas. Nine of the 25 worst places to raise a kid are located in the west, in states like California, New Mexico, and Oregon. Fourteen of those areas are spread out among the South. The remaining two metro areas, Danville, Illinois and Battle Creek, Michigan, are in the Midwest. Four California cities are among the worst to raise children, a larger number than any other state.\\n\\nMore: What city is adding the most jobs in your state? A look at who's hiring\\n\\n25.

Less than a quarter of children age 3 and 4 are enrolled in preschool, one of the lowest preschool enrollment rates in the country. A study published in the American Psychological Association found that attending preschool can increase academic preparedness in children and help cognitive development. Studies have also shown that children who go to preschool are more likely to graduate from high school. Albany's high school graduation rate of 70.9 percent is the 10th lowest among U.S. metropolitan areas.\\n\\n(Photo: Warren-Pender / Getty Images)\\n\\n24.

Only an estimated 64.0 percent of area high school students receive a diploma within four years. No other metro area in the United States had a lower graduation rate. In addition to being a sign of a suboptimal education system, this low graduation rate may also be at least partially due to the economic struggles of residents in the metro area. An estimated 33.6 percent of the area's children live below the national poverty level. Studies have shown that children in low income households are more likely to struggle in school. One report found children in low income households are 15.6 percent less likely to graduate from high school than other students.\\n\\n23.

The high school graduation rate of 71.1 percent is one of the lowest in the country. Across all metro areas, the graduation rate averaged 84.1 percent. It may be also more difficult for children in the area to find a place to get physical activity. Just 65.2 percent of the area population reported having access to a place for exercise. The national share is 83.0 percent. Lacking a place to exercise can be detrimental to a child's development, as children who regularly exercise are less likely to develop health issues such as obesity, high blood pressure, and diabetes.\\n\\n22. Stockton-Lodi, California\\n\\nPreschool enrollment: 36.1 percent (lowest 20 percent)\\n\\n36.1 percent (lowest 20 percent) High school graduation rate: 82.3 percent\\n\\n82.3 percent Pop. with access to areas for exercise: 73.0 percent\\n\\n73.0 percent Violent crime rate: 823.6 per 100,000 (highest 10 percent)\\n\\nIn the Stockton-Lodi metro area, just 36.1 percent of children age 3 or 4 are getting early education before kindergarten, among the lower preschool enrollment rates of U.S. cities. Lacking early education can leave children behind their peers when it comes to educational and emotional development. With an annual violent crime rate of 824 incidents reported per 100,000 residents, the area is one of the most dangerous in the country. The high school graduation rate of 82.3 percent is among the lower rates of U.S. metro areas and slightly below the average rate of 84.1 percent among metro areas.\\n\\nAdults in the area are among the least educated in the country. Just 77.1 percent of Stockton-Lodi adults graduated from high school, one of the lowest rates among U.S. metro areas. Studies show that children in households where parents have lower educational attainment are more likely to struggle in school.\\n\\nMore: US cities where incomes are shrinking at the fastest pace\\n\\n21.

There are 909 violent crimes – which include homicide, robbery, and aggravated assault – reported annually per every 100,000 residents. According to County Health Rankings & Roadmaps, people living in high-crime areas – both adults and children – experience greater stress levels. They also may be deterred from healthy activities like exercise. Just over half of Pine Bluff area residents have no access to a place where they can exercise, one of the lowest rates in the United States.\\n\\n(Photo: SeanPavonePhoto / Getty Images)\\n\\n20.

The Columbia, South Carolina, metro area is one exception. While Columbia's preschool enrollment rate of 58.7 percent is one of the higher such rates among U.S. metro areas, its high school graduation rate of 71.3 percent is one of the nation's lowest. Graduation rates can often be affected by a number of factors, including a lack of community engagement or investment in schools and youth programs.\\n\\n19. Danville, Illinois\\n\\nPreschool enrollment: 39.4 percent\\n\\n39.4 percent High school graduation rate: 78.7 percent (lowest 20 percent)\\n\\n78.7 percent (lowest 20 percent) Pop. with access to areas for exercise: 71.8 percent\\n\\n71.8 percent Violent crime rate: 808.3 per 100,000 (highest 10 percent)\\n\\nDanville, Illinois has one of the biggest violent crime problems in the country. Its residents are among the most likely to report an aggravated assault or a burglary of those in any major metropolitan area. There is a proven connection between children who are raised in a high-crime area and stunted learning development. Danville's high school graduation rate of 78.7 percent is one of the lower rates among metro areas. Danville also has one of the college attainment rates for adults in the U.S. Only 14.0 percent of area adults hold at least a bachelor's degree, less than half the nation's 31.3 percent comparable educational attainment rate.\\n\\nMore: US cities where incomes are growing at the fastest pace\\n\\n18.

In the country as a whole, the national child poverty rate is 19.5 percent. In Albany, that child poverty rate is 36.3 percent. The median annual household income in the area of $40,667 is far below the U.S. median of $57,617. Living in families with financial difficulties makes it more difficult for children to achieve educational success. Some 30 percent of children who grow up in poverty do not graduate from high school. The Albany area's high school graduation rate of 80.8 percent is lower than in most other U.S. cities.\\n\\n17. Yuba City, California\\n\\nPreschool enrollment: 44.1 percent\\n\\n44.1 percent High school graduation rate: 81.5 percent\\n\\n81.5 percent Pop. with access to areas for exercise: 36.6 percent (lowest 10 percent)\\n\\n36.6 percent (lowest 10 percent) Violent crime rate: 397.5 per 100,000\\n\\nStudies have shown that the health benefits associated with getting exercise are mental as well as physical. Physical activity can aid in cognitive development in children, but just 36.6 percent of Yuba City, California, residents have access to a place for physical exercise. Only one other metro area considered has a lower rate of access to exercise amenities. Children are also relatively likely to receive an inadequate education in Yuba City. The area's preschool enrollment and high school graduation rates are both slightly below U.S. averages.\\n\\n16. Hanford-Corcoran, California\\n\\nPreschool enrollment: 35.2 percent (lowest 20 percent)\\n\\n35.2 percent (lowest 20 percent) High school graduation rate: 83.0 percent\\n\\n83.0 percent Pop. with access to areas for exercise: 44.6 percent (lowest 10 percent)\\n\\n44.6 percent (lowest 10 percent) Violent crime rate: 427.0 per 100,000\\n\\nJust 35.2 percent of preschool-aged children in the Hanford-Corcoran area of California are enrolled in preschool, well below the 48.0 percent of children nationwide. The area's adult residents have the second lowest rate of higher educational attainment of all metro areas. Only 11.6 percent have graduated from college – nearly 20 percentage points below the national average. This low level of educational attainment can trickle down to younger generations. Children raised in households where education is a low priority are also less likely to graduate. Hanford-Corcoran residents have little access to exercise. Only 44.6 percent say they have a place for physical activity. Nationally, 83.0 percent have access.\\n\\nMore: SNAP benefits: Which cities have the most people on food stamps?\\n\\n15.

Exercise can be crucial for a child's development and health. Children in high crime areas often have fewer opportunities to go outside to get exercise, and the Florence area also has one of the higher violent crime rates in the country. The area reports a rate of 641 violent crimes per 100,000 residents, compared to a national rate of 386 per 100,000.\\n\\n14.

The Memphis metro area, which extends into three states, is considered one of the worst places to raise a child primarily because of its high violent crime rate. For every 100,000 residents, 1,082 violent crimes were reported. Only two other metro areas had higher rates. Memphis children are also among the most likely to live in families that struggle with financial difficulties. Fewer than 20 percent of children live in poverty nationwide. In Memphis, the child poverty rate is over 30 percent.\\n\\nMore: Cities where Americans are struggling to afford their homes\\n\\n12.

Only a handful of metro areas had a higher rate than 923 violent crimes reported per 100,000 residents in the Louisiana metro area.\\n\\nBabies born to teen mothers are at a greater risk of developing serious health issues, and the Alexandria area has one of the higher teen birth rates in the country. Out of every 1,000 births in Alexandria, 47 are from mothers aged 15-19. The national teen birth rate is 27 per 1,000.\\n\\n(Photo: Rex_Wholster / Getty Images)\\n\\n11.

Odessa, Texas has the highest teen birth rate in the United States as 76 out of every 1,000 children born are born to teenage mothers. The nationwide average is 27 per 1,000 and the next highest birth rate in the country is just 71 per 1,000. High teen pregnancy in Odessa may be one of the reasons why the graduation rate is among the lowest in the nation. Some 30 percent of girls who drop out do so because they are pregnant or have a child.\\n\\n10.

Nationwide, that rate is much higher at 48.0 percent. Violence is also a serious problem in the area, as 895 violent crimes are reported for every 100,000 residents. Despite these challenges, the Anniston area actually has one of the higher graduation rates in the nation. An estimated 92.2 percent of high school students graduated, one of the best rates in the country.\\n\\n(Photo: ferrantraite / Getty Images)\\n\\n9.

Albuquerque has one of the highest violent crime rates in the nation. There were 901 violent crimes reported for every 100,000 Albuquerque residents. The robbery rate, 239 reported robberies per 100,000 people, is more than double the national rate. Less than two-thirds of Albuquerque students graduate from high school on time.

Nationwide, the rate is nearly 40 percentage points higher.\\n\\nIn addition to reporting poor educational outcomes among the area's children, Gadsden is one of the most violent metro areas in the country. The violent crime rate, which is 712 reported instances per 100,000 residents, is particularly driven by assault. There were 569 aggravated assaults per 100,000 residents reported, which is more than double the national rate. Living in an area with serious violent crime issues can reduce a child's sense of well being and hinder emotional development.\\n\\n(Photo: Chilkoot / Getty Images)\\n\\n6.

The Anchorage area is actually among the most affluent in the U.S. with an average family income of $95,872.\\n\\nYet area children still face many problems that tend to affect low-income places. Anchorage has the second-highest violent crime rate in the country, with 1,115 reported violent crimes per 100,000 residents – close to triple the U.S. rate. Children in the Anchorage area are less likely to receive a complete education as well. The preschool enrollment rate of 29.9 percent is well below the 48.0 percent national rate.

Only in six other metro areas are fewer than 20 percent of three and four year olds enrolled in preschool. Children in preschool get an early start on their educational development, and those who do not could have difficulty catching up to their peers. Despite some government assistance, low-income families may have a harder time getting children into preschool.

Only two other metro areas have a lower preschool enrollment rate. The Battle Creek area's median family income is $60,365, falling more than $10,000 short of the national median. Some 26.8 percent of Battle Creek children live in poverty, compared to 19.5 percent of children nationwide.

Farmington, New Mexico\\n\\nPreschool enrollment: 47.0 percent\\n\\n47.0 percent High school graduation rate: 71.8 percent (lowest 10 percent)\\n\\n71.8 percent (lowest 10 percent) Pop. with access to areas for exercise: 52.5 percent (lowest 10 percent)\\n\\n52.5 percent (lowest 10 percent) Violent crime rate: 947.4 per 100,000 (highest 10 percent)\\n\\nFarmington, New Mexico is the worst place in America to raise a child, as it is well below average in a number of key factors that determine what makes a place suitable for raising children. Farmington's violent crime rate of 947 violent crimes reported per 100,000 residents is the fourth-highest in the country. The average community reports 368 violent crimes per 100,000 residents. The Farmington area's high school graduation rate of 71.8 percent is also among the worst in the country. Among metro areas, the average graduation rate is 84.1 percent.\\n\\nA small share of Farmington area residents, 52.5 percent, reported having a place to exercise. This lack of public spaces for exercise can indicate that there is a lack of monetary support for the community. The median family income of $63,973 is several thousand dollars below the national median. Some 25.5 percent of Farmington area children live in poverty, above the national child poverty rate of 19.5 percent.\\n\\nDetailed findings and methodology\\n\\nEach of the components measured in our index – education, health, and safety – are important to the physical and cognitive development of children. A child’s development has been shown to greatly benefit by starting education with a preschool program. Children who complete their education and graduate from high school have greater economic mobility than those who do not. In addition to cognitive development, people also tend to develop healthy habits if they exercise in their youth. It is also important for a child to have a sense of security and well being – something that can be disrupted when a child is raised in a high-crime area.\\n\\nWhen examining the harmful effects that suboptimal living areas can have on children, it can be difficult to isolate a single factor that makes an area a challenging place to raise children.\\n\\nRon Haskins, Co-Director of the Center on Children and Families within The Brookings Institution, said there is a “constellation of factors” that can make a neighborhood an undesirable place to raise children – including a high prevalence of poverty and crime and a lack of childcare.\\n\\nMore: Is your city's population keeping pace? The fastest-growing city in each state\\n\\nHaskins said that, though these issues are less common than in decades past, they are “still perennial problems for low income parents, especially minority low income parents.”\\n\\nThe measures used to determine the worst places to raise children – crime, preschool enrollment, high school graduation, and exercise accessibility – are often inextricably linked, because the conditions that lead to them, including poverty and low adult educational attainment, are shared between all of these issues. Of the 25 places on this list, 22 have an above average crime rate, 23 have a below average preschool enrollment rate, 24 are less likely to have a place to exercise than the average metro area, and 23 have a high school graduation rate below 84.1 percent, which is the average rate among metro areas.\\n\\nTo determine the worst cities to raise children, 24/7 Wall St. ranked metropolitan statistical areas based on an index consisting of high school graduation rate, preschool enrollment rate among 3- and 4-year-olds, violent crime rate, and the percentage of a population with access to places for physical activity. The share of 3- and 4-year olds enrolled in preschool came from the 2016 American Community Survey from the U.S. Census Bureau. Violent crime rates came from the FBI’s 2016 Uniform Crime Report. Graduation rates and the share of the population with access to places for physical activity came from the 2018 County Health Rankings & Roadmaps, a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute joint program.\\n\\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

In the last five years, U.S. unemployment improved by 3.7 percentage points -- from 7.3 percent to 3.6 percent. Similarly, in 43 of the counties on this list unemployment also declined in the last five years. In over half them, the jobless rate has improved faster than the national improvement.\\n\\nHowever, in many cases, declining unemployment rates are not the result of an uptick in hiring, but rather of declining labor force participation. In the last five years, the total number of U.S. workers increased by 3.9 percent. In 38 of the 50 counties on this list, the size of the labor force declined, sometimes by large degrees. In Magoffin County, Kentucky the size of the labor force plunged by 26.7 percent.\\n\\nMore: These are the 25 worst cities in the U.S. to raise children\\n\\nIn many counties on this list, the high unemployment rates are partially attributable to downturns in industries that serve as pillars to the local economy.\\n\\nOil prices collapsed in 2014 and bottomed out in 2016, when a barrel of oil sold for a third of what it did two years prior. America’s oil industry was not spared. Over the 28 months from December 2014 to March 2017, total U.S. employment in oil and gas extraction tanked by 28 percent, from over 200,000 to less than 145,000. In over a dozen counties on this list, natural resources and mining -- which includes oil and gas extraction -- ranks among the top three industries by total employment.\\n\\nThe unemployment rate is perhaps the most widely cited indicator of economic strength or weakness in the United States and, by several other measures, the economies of the counties on this list appear to be struggling.\\n\\nResidents who earn higher incomes can help bolster a local economy, as more disposable income often translates to greater spending. Only five counties on this list have a higher median household income than the national median of $55,322 a year.\\n\\nSimilarly, the vast majority of counties on this list are home to a larger share of residents living in poverty than the 15.2 percent U.S. poverty rate.\\n\\nMethodology\\n\\n24/7 Wall Street reviewed the 50 counties with the highest unemployment rates using employment data recently released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Unemployment rates are for May and were not seasonally adjusted. We included counties, parishes, boroughs, and unorganized boroughs in our analysis. Poverty rates, educational attainment rates, and median household incomes came from the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2016 American Community Survey.\\n\\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

One former White House official declared it “open season on the president.”\\n\\nMorning Media Your guide to the media circus — weekday mornings, in your inbox. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\\n\\nTrump appeared to share that view, tweeting in all-caps on Wednesday: “TREASON?” He then upped the pressure by tweeting that “the Times must, for National Security purposes, turn him/her over to government at once!”\\n\\nThe author was identified by the Times solely as “a senior official in the Trump administration,” setting off a round of finger-pointing within the West Wing that was beginning to spread across the highest levels of the administration. Officials rushed to identify potential writers — an echo of earlier, highly corrosive internal leak investigations. One person familiar with the matter described staffers as “very distraught.”\\n\\nThe op-ed comes amid one of the most brutal periods of Trump’s presidency. Its publication followed last month’s public turn against Trump by Michael Cohen, his former attorney and longtime Trump Organization fixer, who pleaded guilty to federal charges of campaign finance violations relating to payoffs he made in 2016 to silence two women who claimed to have had affairs with Trump.\\n\\nThe president has also endured a public betrayal by his former “Apprentice” sidekick and White House aide Omarosa Manigault Newman, who recently revealed that she’d recorded her colleagues on the Trump campaign and in the West Wing.\\n\\nThe White House was not given a heads up before the op-ed was published Wednesday, just as the president was meeting with Republican congressional leadership. Exhausted aides, who have been in constant crisis mode since early August, were caught off guard, and some close to Trump worried what the increasingly isolated and paranoid president will do next.\\n\\nTrump was furious about the anonymous official’s account, according to people close to him. The op-ed prompted the president to launch into an angry rant against the Times, CNN, and the rest of the “dishonest media” during a Wednesday White House event with sheriffs from across the country.\\n\\n“So when you tell me about some anonymous source within the administration, probably who's failing and probably here for all the wrong reasons, now, and The New York Times is failing,” Trump said in the East Room. “If I weren’t here, I believe The New York Times probably wouldn't even exist.”\\n\\nPress secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, in her statement, added, “The individual behind this piece has chosen to deceive, rather than support, the duly elected president of the United States. He is not putting country first, but putting himself and his ego ahead of the will of the American people. This coward should do the right thing and resign.”\\n\\nVeterans of previous administrations said the op-ed marks a nearly unprecedented departure from the usual rules of decorum for a current official.\\n\\n“We had people who left the Bush administration and turned on us immediately. Scott McClellan. He leaves the Bush administration and goes out and writes this book trashing everybody in the White House,” said Eric Edelman, former undersecretary of defense for policy during the George W. Bush administration, referring to the former Bush White House press secretary. “But to have people inside the administration doing this while they’re there, no.”\\n\\nBut some drew parallels to an incident that roiled the Obama administration.\\n\\nIn 2013 Obama administration officials hunted for a self-identified but unnamed official who tweeted internal gossip and biting commentary under the handle of @NatSecWonk, lambasting figures from Obama adviser Ben Rhodes to Hillary Clinton’s daughter, Chelsea. An elaborate analysis of the tweets focused suspicion on a midlevel National Security Council nuclear arms expert named Jofi Joseph, who was caught after he tweeted information planted in a sting operation. Joseph confessed and was fired. He is now a tax consultant.\\n\\nCurrent and former White House officials joined in the immediate Washington-wide guessing game, trying to figure out who the anonymous official is and extrapolate from the text of the op-ed whether the person works in the West Wing in close proximity to the president or at a federal agency.\\n\\nThe op-ed appeared to offer some clues. It focused heavily on foreign policy issues, lamented Trump’s departure from conservative principles like free markets and praised McCain, who was long the target of Trump’s disdain. Some people close to the White House speculated that the op-ed author works at the National Security Council, the State Department or the Defense Department — but administration officials said they don’t yet know who wrote the op-ed.\\n\\nOne former official said the timing of the op-ed suggested that people inside the administration were acting before the midterm elections in hope that Democrats would win back at least one house of Congress to serve as a check on Trump.\\n\\nBut two former administration officials dismissed the idea that the op-ed would have any lasting effect, contending that the author’s anonymity meant it would do little more than set off a national guessing game.\\n\\n“It’s ridiculous and pompous,” one of the former White House officials said. “As a political appointee, you aren’t there to play God, you’re there to serve the presidency.”\\n\\nThe op-ed, which was headlined “I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration,” argued the root of Trump’s problems as president lie in his “amorality,” adding that “he is not moored to any discernible first principles that guide his decision making.”\\n\\n“[W]e believe our first duty is to this country, and the president continues to act in a manner that is detrimental to the health of our republic,” the official wrote in the op-ed. “That is why many Trump appointees have vowed to do what we can to preserve our democratic institutions while thwarting Mr. Trump’s more misguided impulses until he is out of office.”\\n\\nIn another remarkable claim, the official wrote that members of the president’s Cabinet briefly considered trying to push Trump out of office — but quickly dismissed the idea.\\n\\n“Given the instability many witnessed, there were early whispers within the cabinet of invoking the 25th Amendment, which would start a complex process for removing the president,” the official said. “But no one wanted to precipitate a constitutional crisis. So we will do what we can to steer the administration in the right direction until — one way or another — it’s over.”\\n\\nIn a note to readers, The Times said it made the extraordinary decision to publish the op-ed anonymously because it is “the only way to deliver an important perspective to our readers.” The Times added that the newspaper knows the identity of the official.\\n\\nTrump has long worried that members of his own administration were working against him — and he has roared both in public and in private about leaks to the news media and about the so-called “deep state.” But the anonymous official denied being part of the liberal “resistance” against the president, or the “deep state.”\\n\\n“This isn’t the work of the so-called deep state,” the official wrote. “It’s the work of the steady state.”\\n\\nThe president, who often asks administration officials who they think is leaking to reporters and has a lengthy history of leaking to the media himself, has long sought to take steps to stem the constant flow of information to the press — but the efforts have had little effect.\\n\\nThe Woodward book underscored the extent to which Trump remains subject to the rules of Washington. The Trump White House declined to follow the example of its predecessors and refused to cooperate with Woodward, leaving officials to act as free agents in dealing with the reporter — though, as in most Woodward books, it’s difficult to tell who talked and who didn’t.\\n\\nMany current and former administration officials who were spotlighted in Woodward’s book were furious about how they were portrayed, according to two people familiar with the matter, worried that direct quotes from them included in the tell-all made it look as though they cooperated heavily with the Post reporter.\\n\\nOne person close to Trump marveled at the lack of loyalty many in the administration have shown to Trump, especially for a president who demands loyalty from everybody in his circle. Trump’s outside allies have been warning him privately for months that he shouldn’t trust the administration officials he deals with on a daily basis. “He’s surrounded by strangers,” one former Trump campaign official said of the current makeup of the White House.\\n\\nIn private conversations, administration officials regularly acknowledge their frustration with the president, especially as he continues to criticize the government bureaucracy.\\n\\nIndeed, the anonymous official and others in the administration who don’t see themselves as die-hard Trump supporters have long made the case that their loyalty lies with the presidency, not the president.\\n\\nYet even people in the administration who agreed with parts of the op-ed worried it would only encourage the notoriously stubborn president to retrench. “It reflects how many people feel, but it serves no purpose,” said one administration official. “If the goal was to moderate Trump’s behavior, it will do the opposite.”\\n\\nNancy Cook, Michael Crowley, Nahal Toosi and Rebecca Morin contributed to this report.\", 'clickbait': array(['0'], dtype='<U1')}\n",

But in a tweet condemning the column as “gutless,” Pence’s office denied that he wrote it, charging that “The Vice President puts his name on his Op-Eds.”\\n\\n“The @nytimes should be ashamed and so should the person who wrote the false, illogical, and gutless op-ed”, communications director Jarrod Agen wrote. “Our office is above such amateur acts.”\\n\\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo, on foreign travel in India, also issued a rebuke of the editorial, criticizing the Times for publishing it to begin with and calling for the official’s resignation.\\n\\n“If it\\'s accurate, they should not have chosen to take a disgruntled, deceptive bad actor\\'s word for anything and put it in their newspaper,” Pompeo said Thursday, adding: “I come from a place where if you\\'re not in a position to execute the commander\\'s intent, you have a singular option, that is to leave.”\\n\\n“It’s not mine,” he said.\\n\\nMattis denied that he was responsible through a Pentagon spokesperson to reporters traveling with him in India.\\n\\nIt’s the second repudiation Mattis has had to issue this week to questions that he may have acted to undermine the president. He also denied claims in Bob Woodward’s new book that he disregarded some of the president’s directives and told associates that Trump acted like “a fifth- or sixth-grader.”\\n\\nDirector of National Intelligence Dan Coats on Thursday also denied writing the editorial, calling any speculation that he or his deputy were responsible “patently false.”\\n\\n“From the beginning of our tenure, we have insisted that the entire IC remain focused on our mission to provide the President and policymakers with the best intelligence possible,” he said in a statement, referencing the intelligence community.\\n\\nThe intel chief has broken ranks with the president before, especially when it comes to Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Earlier this summer, his disbelieving response at a cybersecurity forum to learning the president had invited Russian President Vladimir Putin to Washington went viral.\\n\\nA spokesperson for Kirstjen Nielsen rejected the idea that the Homeland Security secretary, who reportedly came close to resigning earlier this year, had authored the piece, saying that she had more pressing concerns. “Secretary Nielsen is focused on leading the men and women of DHS and protecting the homeland - not writing anonymous and false opinion pieces for the New York Times.

The president is amoral, Anonymous wrote. He’s anti-democratic. He’s impetuous, adversarial, petty and ineffective. He flip-flops. He can’t stay on topic and is given to repetitive rants. He’s unstable, says the piece, whose headline and dek tell the story: “I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration: I work for the president but like-minded colleagues and I have vowed to thwart parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations.”\\n\\nStory Continued Below\\n\\nAnonymous, perhaps the deepest Deep Throat since Watergate, continues: He’s only one member of the Trump administration’s internal resistance—he and others monkey-wrenched the White House operation to “do what’s right when Donald Trump won’t.” That’s not news, either, as the press has charted the foot-draggers in the administration. Just Tuesday, we learned from Bob Woodward’s anonymously sourced new book, Fear: Trump in the White House, that aides have pilfered papers from the president’s desk to prevent him from signing them. But the Times’ anonymous op-ed writer makes the case that there’s an ongoing insurrection within the administration. If true, that means 1) Donald Trump, our elected president, isn’t in control of his own team and 2) that the show is being run by anonymous bureaucrats who, depending on how you look at it, are self-anointed patriots or traitors. (We know where the president stands: As I filed this, Trump tweeted simply: “TREASON?”)\\n\\nThe op-ed sent Washington ass-over-applecart because it breaks with the Washington tradition that holds that the accepted way for a government whistleblower to undermine an administration is to leak information to the press (Mark Felt, the original Deep Throat), pilfer documents (Daniel Ellsberg and the Pentagon Papers), or make themselves visible and resign in protest (Attorney General Elliot L. Richardson and Deputy Attorney General William D. Ruckelshaus in Watergate’s Saturday Night Massacre) and join the opposition. For somebody with the paranoiac tendencies of Donald Trump, the op-ed has got to look like something worse than the “deep state” he’s always harping about. It’s like a silent coup.\\n\\nIt goes without saying that the president and his muscle will tear the plasterboard off the West Wing to unmask and punish Anonymous and his confreres. But seeing as Anonymous’ identity is news, the press hounds will be baying, too. Ordinarily, reporters avoid exposing the anonymous sources of other reporters because they don’t want to set a precedent that will result in their sources getting outed.\\n\\nThe rare violation of this mutually assured destruction pact came after Watergate, when everybody and their brother tried to identify the original Deep Throat, Bob Woodward’s secret source in All the President’s Men. Once in the early 1980s, when Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen came close to correctly naming Mark Felt as the mysterious source, Woodward did everything he could do to wave him off. “It’s not him, I said, adopting the well-tested Watergate strategy that when all else fails, lie,” Woodward confesses in his 2005 book, The Secret Man. “Cohen didn’t do the column.”\\n\\nThe New York Times did the right thing in publishing Anonymous because the “first duty of the press “is to obtain the correct intelligence of the events of the time, and instantly, by disclosing them, to make them the common property of the nation.” But having posited the ongoing conspiracy against the president, he can’t expect the press—maybe not even reporters on the news side of the New York Times—to protect his identity. He’s not an anonymous source for a journalist; he’s an anonymous author publishing his work.\\n\\nThis puts him in a separate, more vulnerable category. He’s less like Deep Throat and more like journalist Joe Klein, the anonymous author of the best-selling novel Primary Colors, or Michael Scheuer, the CIA officer turned anonymous author of 2003’s Through Our Enemies’ Eyes and 2004’s Imperial Hubris. Journalists suffered no compunctions about revealing the identities of both authors, and they will work as hard as Trump to uncover him. Don’t feel bad for Anonymous: In Washington, such acts of subterfuge are automatically rewarded with big book contracts.\\n\\nTrump’s response to the op-ed was predictably loopy, helping to make its case that the president wallows in a world of delusion. He rushed onto TV to recite the economic accomplishments of his administration and denounce the New York Times and other outlets as “phony.” Somewhere, the Resistance that Anonymous helps lead was busy sharpening its pencils and shredding documents they don’t want the president to sign. And the 25th Amendment was trending on Google.\\n\\n******\\n\\nAnonymice clog my mail at Shafer.Politico@gmail.com.

The op-ed raised a host of ethical and journalistic questions many have never considered before, including whether Times news reporters — who work independent of the editorial department, which published the op-ed — should now set about determining the identity of an anonymous Times opinion writer.\\n\\nOne Times reporter said colleagues were already volleying back and forth with sources, trying to guess the writer’s identity. But for others, a sense of annoyance quickly set in, with some journalists frustrated about the position the Times’ editorial page had put the news section in.\\n\\nTimes reporter Jodi Kantor summed up the conundrum on Twitter, writing, “So basically: Times reporters now must try to unearth the identity of an author that our colleagues in Opinion have sworn to protect with anonymity?” She added: “Or is the entire newspaper bound by the promise of anonymity? I don’t think so, but this is fascinating. Not sure if there’s precedent.”\\n\\nMorning Media Your guide to the media circus — weekday mornings, in your inbox.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\\n\\nEthical questions aside, there might also be strategic concerns for reporters. While the news and opinion sections operate separately, that point could be lost on potential sources, who could be spooked by Times news reporters working to reveal a Times editorial source.\\n\\n“I don’t think any of us were expecting it,” said Helene Cooper, a veteran Times reporter who covers the Pentagon, adding, “I was shocked when I saw it.” Cooper said that while she was still processing the decision, she was not unhappy about it.\\n\\n“My first reaction was, ‘Why are we doing this?’” she said. “But the more I think about it, is there any difference between that and when we give anonymity to sources?”\\n\\nThe Times’ opinion section has granted writers anonymity in the past. But that’s typically because the author, such as an undocumented immigrant or Syrian refugee, would be in clear danger if his or her identity were revealed. Dao said it was the first time in “anyone’s memory that we’ve done it with an American official.”\\n\\nIn the op-ed, the Times said it was withholding the author’s identity because the writer’s “job would be jeopardized by its disclosure.” That same justification is frequently used by Times reporters to grant sources anonymity, but Dao said that on the opinion side, editors don’t view an official speaking out in quite the same way that reporters view sources.\\n\\n“We don’t call these people sources, we call them writers,” Dao said.\\n\\n“Our mission is a bit different,” he added. “It’s to get people to write as honestly as they can about what they’re experiencing.”\\n\\nIn the piece, the senior administration official described high-ranking staffers as “working diligently from within to frustrate parts of [Trump’s] agenda and his worst inclinations” and having even discussed invoking the 25th Amendment to possibly remove the president from office.\\n\\nWhile Trump’s erratic behavior and the concerns of exasperated staffers have been chronicled before, The Times’ framing and first-person perspective helped the piece ricochet quickly across social media. It also appeared amid this week’s frenzy over Bob Woodward’s forthcoming book, “Fear,” which, according to The Washington Post , depicts “Trump’s inner sanctum” as trying “to control his impulses and prevent disasters.”\\n\\nThe president already trashed Woodward’s book on Tuesday, claiming the legendary journalist “made up” quotes. (Woodward says he stands by his reporting.) On Wednesday, Trump took aim at the “failing New York Times” for running what he called a “gutless editorial.” He later cryptically tweeted, “Treason?”\\n\\nDao said the senior administration official reached out to him through an intermediary. He said the op-ed page is a platform to “let people express themselves in their own words” and that “there was no effort to hide, mask or otherwise distort the person’s writing voice.”\\n\\nAcross Twitter, internet sleuths pounced, as users fixated on keywords and clues to try to run down the writer’s identity. A few Times accounts even provided unintentional, but inaccurate, clues.\\n\\nAssistant Managing Editor Sam Dolnick tweeted about an op-ed from a “senior White House staffer” — as opposed to the op-ed itself, which referred much more broadly to a “senior administration official.” He later had to walk back his tweet, saying , “I have zero knowledge about the identity.”\\n\\nSimilarly, The Times’ official Twitter account referred to the writer as “he,” but Times spokeswoman Eileen Murphy said that the tweet , which remains up, was an error and that the person who posted it does not know the op-ed writer’s identity; only senior opinion editors do.\\n\\nCooper said she expected that Times reporters would try to determine the identity of the writer, like journalists at any other outlet.\\n\\n“That’s our job, right?” she said. “The first thing I wanted to know was who wrote it, but I can guarantee you that the op-ed section is not going to tell us.”\\n\\nNo, the op-ed section isn’t going to tell reporters the writer’s identity — or how they should handle it.\\n\\n“The Times newsroom is going to do what it’s going to do,” Dao said. “Just as they do not demand we run a certain op-ed, we don‘t tell them what to report on and not report on.”\\n\\n', 'clickbait': array(['1'], dtype='<U1')}\n",

He might succumb, or he might not. But what’s inarguably true is that he’s not unused to this sort of moment. He’s not even uncomfortable with it. At his previous point of maximum peril—his financial collapse and the detonation of his marriage in 1990—Trump came out with a book of his own. It was called Surviving at the Top.\\n\\nThe title at the time was presumptuous to the point of preposterous. “Surviving” was a premature claim that only he believed. The front-cover boast is actually far truer now than it was back then—he is, after all, the president of the United States—and the takeaway from Surviving at the Top is not even so much that he’s good at skirting calamity. It’s that a crisis is something he actually enjoys.\\n\\nStory Continued Below\\n\\n“I realized,” Trump writes in the book, with the help of collaborator Charles Leerhsen, “that I was doing what I love to do most—battle back from the brink.”\\n\\nThe stakes of course—and this is the essential caveat when trying to explain his current predicament based on his past performance—are exponentially greater now. He doesn’t understand Washington the way he did New York. He doesn’t know governance the way he did real estate. His current adversaries are by nature and magnitude fundamentally different. Has a president ever suffered the humiliation of one of his senior officials penning an anonymous op-ed to reassure the public an internal resistance is at work to save the country from their boss? Still, if there’s “fear” here, it’s not Trump who’s necessarily feeling it the most. And he has proved over the course of his life to be blissfully impervious to “a nervous breakdown.”\\n\\n“He is fearless,” Roger Stone, the former campaign adviser who’s known Trump since 1979, told me in a text message Wednesday afternoon. “He is tough as nails.” Stone, who has a tattoo on his back of Richard Nixon because of his admiration for the late 37th president, then added something about Trump that shocked me: “Makes Nixon look like a cream puff.” Nixon? “Nixon was smarter,” Stone responded, “but Trump is tougher.”\\n\\n“Pure grit,” texted Sam Nunberg, another former Trump political adviser. Also on Nunberg’s Roy Cohn-like list of Trump’s survival skills: “confidence,” “a knack for spotting his rivals’ weaknesses” and “ATTACK, ATTACK, ATTACK … NEVER DEFEND!”\\n\\nTrump biographer Tim O’Brien told me “being a survivor” was “not just one of his strengths” but “a core and overriding strength.”\\n\\n“Trump,” Jack O’Donnell, a former executive at one of Trump’s Atlantic City casinos, wrote to me in an email on Wednesday, “is way more than a survivor. He is probably the ultimate survivor. The fact that he is POTUS says it all. In the process of becoming the president, he made mistakes that no other politician would have survived. Refusing to release tax returns, his racist comments, his comments regarding woman … the ‘Access Hollywood’ tape. Name one politician that would have survived.”\\n\\nBack at the time of Surviving at the Top, Trump survived largely because of the ever-present aid and cushion of his father’s fortune as well as the reality that banks had lent him so much money that they were as beholden to him as he was to them. “The banks,” in the words of a former Trump employee I talked to on Wednesday, “were his adversaries and his allies.” They didn’t want to snuff him out—they wanted him to survive. Other foes were the same way. Ivana Trump was his adversary—but a broke, ruined Trump was no good for her, either. New York’s then-mayor, Ed Koch, loathed him and constantly butted heads with him—but in the end, more or less, wanted Trump to keep building and being a character in his pro-business city. And the legion of his celebrity squabbles? Mostly mutually beneficial. “He has been shrewd for decades at figuring out how to make his preservation in the interest of whoever might be standing in his way,” said biographer Gwenda Blair.\\n\\nWith Trump, listening for too long, or reading too deeply, is an experience that inevitably devolves into self-contradiction that ultimately borders on ideological incoherence. Surviving at the Top is in this respect no different. In it, for instance, Trump tells his readers both not to “think you’re so smart that you can go it alone” and also that he’s “a guy who prefers to negotiate one-on-one” and doesn’t “like answering to a board of directors.” He makes his customary space for score-settling (Malcolm Forbes, investigative journalist Wayne Barrett and the “sick” press are some targets) and self-serving asides (“I’ve never had any trouble in bed …”). And he plays his usual role as the put-upon outer-borough boy everybody’s out to get. He says he thought about calling the book Everybody Hates a Winner. At the same time, I’ve long considered Surviving at the Top (relatively speaking) the most textured and revealing title of the Trump canon. There are snippets of self-reflection and tiny but unmistakable glimpses of vulnerability. “Anyone who makes it to the top of his profession will tell you, if he’s honest, that his worst potential enemy is himself,” he writes. And it’s hard not to sense that a small part of him really was wondering if he would emerge from his colossal indebtedness intact. “I’ve joked,” he says, “about ending sections of this book with a question mark.”\\n\\nBut those parts eventually lose out to a more familiar posture.\\n\\n“My main purpose in life is to keep winning,” he tells his readers. “And the reason for that is simple: If I don’t win, I don’t get to fight the next battle.”\\n\\nAnd the key to fight—and win—the next battle?\\n\\nToughness.\\n\\n“Toughness,” he declares, “in the long run, is a major secret of my survival.”\\n\\nHe compares himself to “the great football running backs of years past. These were not gentle men—yet no one ever accused them of being unfair. Sometimes you saw them just plowing ahead, sometimes side-stepping, sometimes spinning off blockers, and sometimes straight-arming opponents. … and yet one thing never changed. They were always moving forward.”\\n\\nAnd he adds: “Occasionally, yes, toughness does involve some old-fashioned ass-kicking.”\\n\\n“The opposite of toughness—weakness—makes me mad and sometimes turns my stomach,” he concludes.\\n\\nWhen one rereads Surviving at the Top, going on three decades later, the question is whether any part of this equation remains applicable now. With danger, it seems, increasingly everywhere Trump looks, can he still manage to not fail or fall? Can his stubbornness overcome the incompetence that his own staffers have revealed to multiple authors?\\n\\nHis biographers are conflicted.\\n\\n“I think he could completely keep on going,” O’Brien said.\\n\\n“What’s different now is that he’s exposed in a way he’s never been before,” Blair said. “It’s getting harder and harder to rely on the usual punch-back, double-down, blame-others strategy.”\\n\\nFellow Trump chronicler Michael D’Antonio agrees that the “geopolitical implications” are so much starker. He worries that “the office itself will be degraded.” But Trump? “He can go from debacle to debacle,” D’Antonio said, “and remain in office.”\\n\\nOn Wednesday, when we talked on the phone, Nunberg predicted Republicans would keep the House of Representatives and Trump would win again in 2020. Trump himself said Wednesday at the White House that “nobody is going to come close” to beating him.\\n\\n“Sometimes,” Trump writes on the last page of Surviving at the Top, “if you hang in there long enough and, as the boxing trainers always say, ‘keep punching till the bell,’ people take notice and give you a boost.”\\n\\nTrump presents as evidence a passage from an editorial in the New York Times in June 1990.\\n\\nTrump “has given non-admirers plenty of reasons for the malicious glee with which they hear of his problems,” he quotes the editorial as saying. “Good at his business, at every opportunity he tells the world how good. He feels compelled to paint the name TRUMP on every acquisition. He flaunts his possessions: the biggest yacht, the biggest house, the grandest helicopter, and not long ago pronounced his intention of building the tallest building in the world. His main motive was not greed but triumph.”\\n\\nIt continues: “Arrogance? For sure, and yet in a world lacking individual heroes, even some of the Donald’s critics must confess to a sneaking respect for his insistence on being himself, however outrageous, and catch themselves hoping he’ll find the strength and luck to escape.”\\n\\nI checked, just to make sure he had quoted this editorial correctly, and he had—except for the deletion of three key words at the very end.\\n\\n“… the strength and luck to escape,” it read, “his just deserts.”\\n\\nThe difference between reality TV and a morality play.\\n\\n\\n\\nMichael Kruse is a senior staff writer for Politico.', 'clickbait': array(['1'], dtype='<U1')}\n",

But the day before the document leaked, Kavanaugh was asked on about the exact sentiment he shared back in 2003 and portrayed it as merely a restatement of legal scholars’ opinion, “different from … my position as a judge.”\\n\\nBeyond Kavanaugh’s email on abortion rights, first reported by The New York Times, other Democrats on Thursday morning released separate committee-confidential documents from his past.\\n\\nAfter Sen.

McConnell and Pelosi will be up for reelection in 2020, and their decisions on whether to run will have a huge impact on what Congress look would like heading into possibly a second term for Trump, or with a new president in the Oval Office.\\n\\nNeither leader would agree to give an interview for this article. Aides to both leaders said discussions about what could happen next year are premature, despite the fact that Pelosi released a letter on Tuesday saying Democrats “must be ready for the prospect that we will be in the majority in January.”\\n\\nHowever, lawmakers in both chambers already are preparing for a possible Democratic takeover of the House, and what it would mean vis-a-vis a GOP-run Senate.\\n\\n“I think if you just look at it objectively, that’s a very real possibility,” Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) said of a McConnell and Pelosi-led Congress. “I think it could be quite helpful, quite frankly, in 2020. If you turn the House over to Nancy Pelosi, the Democrats’ agenda will be in full display before the American people – abolishing ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement], it will be about impeachment, it will be about a lot of issues that are out of the mainstream for most Americans.”\\n\\nHouse Democrats, for their part, most likely would make Trump and his performance as president the issue — first, last and always.\\n\\nRep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.) called McConnell “a cold-blooded pragmatist” when it comes to legislation, and said the Kentucky Republican would do what he had to do to keep the government open and functioning.\\n\\n“[McConnell] will make deals if he has to,” Connolly said, “and we will do what we need to do to govern effectively and efficiently.”\\n\\nThese two legendary septuagenarian lawmakers — McConnell is 76, and Pelosi is 78 — have run their caucuses for more than a decade each. They both have reputations as deal-makers and vote counters, and they have dealt directly with each other as Appropriations subcommittee chairs in the past.\\n\\nBut the two share little personally other than being nearly the same age, being vilified politically, and having deep experience as negotiators. They hardly make small talk when together and are polar opposites on ideology and policy.\\n\\n“They don’t really have much of a relationship, and when they do interact, it's very transactional,” said a person familiar with the dynamics between the two leaders. “The circumstance that they would be in the room together … it’s some deadline driven event where all parties agree a solution is necessary and failure is not option.”\\n\\nPelosi and McConnell were rarely conferring during must-pass negotiations during their respective tenures as party leaders, despite the fact they were both in the room on fiscal stimulus, default scares and government shutdown negotiations. Throughout President Barack Obama’s tenure, former Vice President Joe Biden often took the lead with Senate Republicans; the McConnell-Biden relationship was especially important in those situations, as the two old colleagues were able to cut deals that McConnell was unable to reach with former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) Since Trump took over, it’s usually been Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) dealing with McConnell.\\n\\nA Democratic source said McConnell and Pelosi are both “savvy negotiators,” and said they had been involved in talks on appropriations bills.\\n\\nHowever, one serious sticking point has emerged between Pelosi and McConnell, one that isn’t going to disappear anytime soon. In a recent interview on MSNBC, Pelosi suggested McConnell had made a “racist statement” during a 2010 interview when the Kentucky Republican said his focus was to make Obama a “one-term president.” Pelosi – who misquoted McConnell during her MSNBC appearance – called McConnell’s comment “unthinkable.”\\n\\nA Washington Post fact check found Pelosi’s position on the McConnell statement inaccurate, noting “we are flummoxed how this anodyne political statement then is twisted into being an allegedly racist statement.” A source close to Pelosi said the California Democrat suggested the statement was racist, not McConnell himself, though he is intensely aware of Pelosi’s comment, according to sources close to the Kentucky Republican.\\n\\nIt would be a remarkable comeback for the longtime Democratic leader if she regained the speaker’s gavel. No one has pulled off this move since the iconic Sam Rayburn of Texas did it in the mid-1950s. To do so — beyond Democrats winning 218 seats — Pelosi would have to overcome doubts among some in her caucus that she should become speaker again. Pelosi is confident she could do so, as are a growing number of top Democrats on the Hill.\\n\\n“Nancy Pelosi’s a very smart, very practical, strategic person. I think she can work with anybody,” said Michigan Sen. Debbie Stabenow, a former House member now in Democratic leadership.\\n\\n“I can’t tell you whether they do or they don’t [get along], but I can tell you in the 20-plus years I’ve been here I’ve watched them both mellow. So there’s no reason why they wouldn’t, or couldn’t sit down and negotiate something,” said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who hails from Pelosi’s hometown of San Francisco and has known both Pelosi and McConnell for decades.\\n\\nGoverning under unified Republican rule has been a challenge for Republicans, but the GOP has at least collaborated on tax reform, confirming judges and rolling back Obama-era regulations. It’s not entirely clear there would be any such mutual understanding under divided government; senators said even an infrastructure package would prove very difficult to pass.\\n\\n“That obviously becomes more complicated with Nancy Pelosi and the center of gravity in the House is on the far left. It would be hard to get policies that are sort of on the middle of the spectrum,” said Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, a former GOP House member now in Senate leadership.\\n\\nThe impeachment question would also hang over any of their attempts to make government work. McConnell would likely be doing everything he could to fend it off while Pelosi navigate her own internal politics.\\n\\n“It would certainly be a polarizing event. It’s hard enough as it is, but that would make it harder,” said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas. “They’re both professionals. But obviously [they] have dramatically different views of the world when it comes to policy. But I think they would work together if that were to happen.”\\n\\nDemocrats also are keenly aware of how tough the 2020 Senate map is for Republicans. The GOP would have to defend 22 seats compared with just 12 Democratic seats. Some Democrats believe that McConnell, who has already said he’s running next cycle, will seek to distance Senate Republicans from Trump if the president looks like he’ll lose his bid for a second term in the White House. But there is no sign of that happening, and it’s not clear it would matter, anyway, as Republicans can expect to get hit with Trump no matter what happens.\\n\\n“There are relationships in this town that should be dysfunctional that end up being OK,” said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.). “If Mitch has a feeling that Trump is a liability going into 2020 — which is a much more dangerous year for Republicans – maybe he’s not going to be in the business of doing Trump’s bidding.”\\n\\n\", 'clickbait': array(['0'], dtype='<U1')}\n",

I wanted to let her know I was interested in replacing Bill as undersecretary for political affairs at the State Department. At the time, I was vice-chair of Albright Stonebridge Group, a global consulting firm. I already had several years of experience at State, first as assistant secretary of state for legislative affairs under former Secretary of State Warren Christopher and then as former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright’s counselor in the 1990s.\\n\\nCheryl and I had some initial conversations that seemed to indicate I was being considered. Then things went silent. In Washington, interviewing for a major position is a bit of a blood sport. Reporters and pundits kick around names quite publicly, so success or failure is never a private matter. If I was going to be passed over, I wondered whether it was better that my name had fallen off the roster early. In any case, there was nothing further to be done.\\n\\nStory Continued Below\\n\\nSome weeks later, Cheryl called to say I was back under consideration. Would I meet her for a Sunday breakfast to discuss?\\n\\nWhen we met, Cheryl explained that the secretary was disposed favorably toward me but that a concern had been raised about me that I was not a team player and thus wouldn’t be a good fit. I strained to figure out where this was coming from. I thought perhaps it emanated from when I had been assistant secretary of legislative affairs, a post that required me to tell powerful people in the State Department that their priority was not the president’s and thus, they could not go up to Capitol Hill to push for their own agendas. It was hard to imagine that I’d be faulted years afterward for doing what was only my job. As we talked, however, it became clear that “not a team player” really meant “too assertive.”\\n\\nI was stunned. Throughout my career, I’d been called “tough.” It was a compliment that was regularly paid to women in Washington who demanded excellent work, but of course, it always sounded less begrudging when it was said of a man. In the competition for the political affairs job, “tough” had somehow become “too assertive.” Critiques like this one, along with being called “ambitious” or “aggressive,” are often lodged against women. They had been lodged against Secretary Clinton and Cheryl herself. Indeed, I was dismayed that these two very strong and powerful women believed about me the very unfair criticisms that had been pointed at them. Cheryl said she would get back to me.\\n\\nFinally, an evening meeting was set up at Secretary Clinton’s home in Washington. Hillary and I talked about the job itself and my ideas for how to do it, but eventually she brought up some of the same questions Cheryl had. She respected me enough to be direct with me about what she’d heard, and I answered with the same honesty, repeating what I’d told Cheryl. I left still not knowing if an offer would come.\\n\\nHachette Book Group\\n\\nIn Washington, no advocate is more valuable than the person who did the job before you, and did it well. Bill Burns, with whom I had worked closely during Bill Clinton\\'s presidency, was one of my champions inside the department. He stepped in, telling the secretary that I would be a great team player. In the end, Secretary Clinton, with President Barack Obama’s agreement, nominated me to the post, and I became the first woman undersecretary of state for political affairs.\\n\\nIt was not the first time I realized what a tricky thing it is to be a powerful woman in Washington, nor was it the last. Two years later, for instance, in October 2013, I had to break the news to my Iran negotiation counterparts, known as the P5+1 and EU, that I had known about secret back-channel talks with Iran that had started in Oman months ago. This was an admission that revealed to them, and myself, that I had finally, fully assumed the mantle of U.S. power; that I was comfortable with negotiating from a place of strength and going it alone if necessary. It took the better part of a career in Washington, where calcified work structures make it so difficult for women, to learn how to be comfortable owning my own power—a necessary step if you are to wield it successfully.\\n\\nPower comes naturally to some people. I don’t think anyone who knew me as a teenager back in Baltimore would have picked me to be running a major nuclear arms deal 30 years later. My sister recalls me as a preteen homebody who liked to sit in her room and read.\\n\\nLuckily, since then, I’ve had wonderful role models who taught me how to understand power. One is my friend, former boss and business partner, Secretary Albright. Years ago, when she was serving as U.N. ambassador in the Clinton administration, Madeleine told me that the trick is not to simply wield your personal power, but to own the power of your office. Who, after all, can truly measure up to the outsize might of the United States? “When you sit across the negotiating table,” Madeleine told me, “you are the United States of America, not Wendy. If you know that and use that, it matters more than the fact that you’re a woman.” Madeleine showed me that owning that power was quite something.\\n\\nFormer Senator Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, for whom I was chief of staff and then campaign manager in the 1980s, showed me one way of owning my power. Barbara doesn’t just assume a role—she transforms it by inhabiting it. Not even five feet tall and comfortably round, Barbara makes for an unlikely politician, as she acknowledged when running for the Senate in 1985. “I’m not particularly glamorous-looking,” she later told an interviewer about her difficulty measuring up to her primary opponents, Rep. Mike Barnes and Gov. Harry Hughes, also flatly stating that “I just didn’t look the part.” Barbara had no hope of growing more “senatorial,” saying, “I guess they don’t make togas in size 14 petite.”\\n\\nWatching Barbara over the past 40 years and more, I’ve seen that the powerful role you take on can eventually be—and should be—very close to the person you really are. You should change and grow in the role, but you can also change the way people think of the office you fill. Recalling how she was able to find her place in the male-dominated Senate in 1986 (there was only one other female senator when she arrived, Nancy Kassebaum), Barbara said her attitude was, “This is what the part looks like, and this is what the part is going to look like.\"\\n\\nI’ve learned a lot from men wielding their power too, and I’ve greatly admired many of them. The question of how women use their power, however, is far more complicated, more difficult and more urgent today than it is for men. Women, it must be said, have a strange relationship with power. We aren’t afraid of it necessarily, but we seem more comfortable with informal power than institutional power.\\n\\nEarly in my career, while organizing in local neighborhoods, I did a study with another social work student, looking at the evolution of leadership in neighborhood organizations. Most often those organizations were started by women who, in order to protect their children, wanted the city to install a traffic light at a busy intersection, or worried about safe drinking water for their families. Women got busy and got the job done, without asking whether they could do so, when they could do something for someone else. As soon as their efforts had attracted the backing of grants and donors—that is, at the point that advocacy became an organization—men invariably stepped in. Whether elected or self-appointed, men became the head of the organization once the women had built it.\\n\\nPerhaps this is why women are sometimes more comfortable working within a group. When I took on the job of Mikulski’s chief of staff in the House, I found solace in a group of female chiefs of staff (or “administrative assistants,” as both men and women were known then). Eleanor Lewis ran New York Rep. Gerry Ferraro’s team. Nancy LeaMond was chief of staff for Rep. Mary Rose Oakar of Ohio. Nikki Heidepriem had led efforts on behalf of women’s issues for the Democratic presidential campaign in 1984. Kitty Higgins worked for Michigan Rep. Sandy Levin.\\n\\nAt our monthly Chinese take-out dinners in one another\\'s homes, we talked about common issues and brainstormed better ways to do our jobs and manage our personal lives. This bunch of seasoned political aides sustained me when I was learning the job on the fly, constantly playing catch-up and thinking sometimes that I was going to lose my mind.\\n\\nBut in those primitive days for women in the House, we did more than comfort one another. We proved, at least to one another, that it was possible to do our jobs and still live full lives and not go crazy. We talked one another through the rough spots and served as models for one another. It was only after I became pregnant with my daughter—I had told Barbara when she hired me that I hoped to have a child in the near future—that Nancy LeaMond felt that she could do the same. Just by being there, we established that we could be both women and chiefs of staff. In doing so, we changed one another and in ways large and small changed everyone’s expectations about working in the House.\\n\\nI would never give up the friendships I formed with those women. But looking back, I realize that we already had the skills to do our jobs before we started. We had the smarts to learn the ropes on our own. Women are often in denial about their own capabilities and search for others—groups of women or commanding men—to establish their power. When doing important personal work, like caring for our parents and children, the old and the young—both tasks that fall primarily to women—we are far more adept at adapting to new work and unfamiliar situations. When called on to make ends meet, we do what we must without stopping to doubt ourselves. Women excel at times when they have no choice but to take the job and do their best. Why can’t we have the same confidence in the jobs we want and like as well? We may not always have the knowledge going in, but I’d trust any woman to figure out nearly any job.\\n\\nGuys rarely question whether they can do the next job up. In my experience, they say yes and either worry about what they need to know later or—it’s been known to happen—not at all. There is research that indicates this isn’t just my own anecdotal observation. A widely cited internal study done by Hewlett-Packard in 2017 showed that men will apply for a job when they have 60 percent of the qualifications for the post; women will do so only when they can show that they have all of them.\\n\\nIt’s an open question precisely why women continue to deny their own capabilities, despite the past century of feminist activism. We know that women are still told to be quiet, and that we are still interrupted when we don’t comply. We know that men are told to push themselves forward while women are told to hang back. We worry when we are given more responsibility or more power, and too often we still believe that we don’t know enough, aren’t skilled enough, aren’t substantive enough, to do what the job we are applying for requires. When I became the assistant secretary for legislative affairs at the State Department, I’d already run a congressional representative’s office and a Senate campaign and served as executive director of both EMILY’s List and the Democratic National Committee during a national presidential campaign (Mike Dukakis’). My résumé was among the most accomplished in Washington. Yet when the job was offered to me, I was completely overwhelmed by what I didn’t know.\\n\\nNone of this is to say that confidence alone is enough to combat bias in fields where women are underrepresented. The field of national security and foreign policy has long been the domain of men. Although we have had three female secretaries of state, a glance at the major foreign policy publications and the panelists at major conferences will show that our security and diplomacy leaders are still predominantly men.\\n\\nIt is not our numbers alone that put us at a disadvantage. As undersecretary of state for political affairs, I often attended meetings in the White House Situation Room, the underground, secure conference room where senior policymakers debate the government’s way forward, often with the president in the room to finalize the decisions being made. At the time, the top positions on the National Security Council were all occupied by women, with Susan Rice as national security adviser and Avril Haines and Lisa Monaco as her deputies. These amazingly talented women, then all in their 40s, gave away nothing to male staffers in the depth of their analysis or their ability to articulate it. Yet even in this environment, men’s voices were heard differently than the women’s. As we went around the table giving our views on the topic of the day, one of the women would make a point. After one or two speakers had followed with further comments, a man at the table would inevitably repeat nearly verbatim the point made by Susan, Avril, Lisa or me. To my amazement, no one would remark that the point had already been made; rather, they would affirm their male colleague’s statement by saying, “Good point.”\\n\\nSoon a quiet realization dawned on us: We girls had to stick together. The women of the Situation Room developed an unspoken rule. When any man commented by repeating something that had been said earlier by a woman, one of the other women at the table would jump in. “I’m glad you agree with what ——— just said,” one of us would say about our female colleague’s identical comment, or else, “That builds nicely on the point ——— made just before.” We tried to be subtle—so subtle sometimes that I’m not convinced it always penetrated the consciousnesses of the men in the room. But we did what we could to make sure we were heard, affirmed and acknowledged, which was a wonderfully empowering experience.\\n\\nI try to do something similar when I do speaking engagements. After I’ve finished my prepared remarks, I customarily open the floor to questions. The first questioner is almost always a man, usually followed by another man. If by the fourth question no women have raised their hands, I stop the question period and say that I won’t continue until I hear from some of the women in the room. That brings nervous laughter, recognition and finally some raised hands from women.\\n\\nThe real drawback of this dynamic is that it affects how women do their jobs. When Madeleine Albright became the first female secretary of state, she understood that her first task was to assure people that she was strong enough to do the job. So she asked President Bill Clinton to nominate Strobe Talbott, Tom Pickering, Stu Eizenstat and Tim Wirth as her deputy and key undersecretaries. Rather than an admission that she needed men’s help, appointing men to these spots sent the message that she could handle, and even welcome, their strength. It must have been incredibly frustrating to constantly have to prove her ease with the role she was so clearly cut out for. For her closest staff, she hired women who could be counted on for a straightforward chat when she needed to get her thoughts in order—Elaine Shocas to be her chief of staff, with Suzy George as deputy chief of staff. Along with me as her counselor, Madeleine always had a travel companion with whom she could talk directly about her own use of power or, if needed, whether she needed to reapply her lipstick.\\n\\nMadeleine also had to take care to show that she was willing to fight. Not a warmonger by any stretch of the imagination, she did understand that women are perceived as hesitant to use force. As U.N. ambassador, she had burnished her credentials when she traveled with the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General John Shalikashvili, to peacekeeping missions. When she became secretary, her approach to the conflict in Kosovo was so adept that Time magazine put her on the cover with the line, “Madeleine’s War.”\\n\\nWhen I consider how Madeleine managed to change the way we think of women in power, I see that she did it by embracing her femininity, by never falling into the trap of acting like a man to claim equality with men. Madeleine loves clothes and chooses what she wears with care. From her trademark brooches that she used to make diplomatic points to her impeccable style of dress and her love of popular culture, she didn’t allow the role of secretary of state to change the fact that she was a woman.\\n\\nEven working at the highest levels of government, I saw countless casual, workaday examples of the diminishment of women’s power, usually the kind dismissed as minor annoyances, the kind of jostling that can be found whenever men and women come together. As a group of us were sorting out last details on the eve of announcing the final Iran nuclear agreement in Vienna in 2015, some of the foreign ministers who had already arrived in town went to dinner with a few aides. It so happened that, because of the extraordinary composition of the P5+1 team, those of us still leading the work were mostly women. As we worked to get to closure on the last details of the agreement, text messages began to transmit back to some of us that some ministers were making derogatory jokes about how much more efficient the process would be if men were in charge. We agreed not to get distracted by the misogyny and just get the work done.\\n\\nOften, when women make an effort to be recognized, our demand to be valued isn’t enough—men have to validate us, as Bill Burns did for me with Secretary Clinton, or else other, more powerful women have to intervene.\\n\\nMore women need to stand up for each other. In many places, but especially in Washington, there is a tight cadre of guys in national security and foreign policy who recommend each other on a consistent basis for every good job that comes along. We women need to do the same for each other and insist that the boys’ network consider capable women as well when those jobs come along.\\n\\nMore than anything, women have to become more accustomed to getting power. And we need to recognize the power we already possess.\\n\\nWomen need to stop thinking that “power” is a dirty word, or that the trappings of power matter less than the work. When President Clinton and Secretary Albright asked me to come back to government as Madeleine’s counselor, I asked to be confirmed with the rank of ambassador. It was one of the smartest things I ever asked for. I knew that as a woman and without line authority, I needed some heft beyond the position, and so the Senate confirmed me as an ambassador. It has been immensely helpful. When, in that position, I led American delegations to, for instance, trilateral talks with Japan and South Korea on North Korea and all the delegations were men, being “Ambassador Sherman” undoubtedly helped when I dealt with North Korea. The title has been helpful ever since.\\n\\nWomen have a tremendous amount of power that comes with the roles we play in society, far more power than we ever had before. We cannot wield this power positively without understanding our strengths and owning them. At the same time, we have to appreciate that so many of the remaining obstacles to women’s advancement— most blatantly, perhaps, the sexual harassment in the workplace that has become an important topic of conversation—are all about power. We must each have the courage to stand up for what is right. We also need to rediscover the power of working collectively and become adept at using social media to speak with one voice. The challenge for many of us remains the interpersonal moments, when we have to risk being called tough, aggressive, even difficult. Our only response must be to continue to view—and use—power positively.\\n\\nAdapted from Not for the Faint of Heart: Lessons in Courage, Power, and Persistence by Ambassador Wendy R. Sherman.

Mike Capuano — that, in a majority-minority district, the promise of a younger woman of color was worth dumping a reliably liberal, older white male incumbent — represented a serious departure from past party practice. But it made perfect sense to a younger and more radicalized Trump-era Democratic electorate in Capuano’s liberal, Boston-area district.\\n\\n\\n\\nPressley’s win capped two weeks of party establishment setbacks, including Gillum’s upset last week of former Rep. Gwen Graham in Florida’s gubernatorial primary. On Tuesday, the forces of the progressive tea party appeared to leave their mark in another major race — playing at least a supporting role in Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s decision not to seek a third term.\\n\\nThe brash Chicago mayor had a difficult, though eminently winnable, reelection campaign ahead. But as a devotee of a vision of Democratic Leadership Council-oriented centrist governance that is no longer in favor — particularly in the nation’s biggest cities — Emanuel’s path to a third term figured to be a painful slog.\\n\\nThough he had engineered the Democratic Party’s takeover of the House in 2006, back home progressives had long since left his side. And had he won another term, he faced the prospect of a City Council fortified with even more progressives.\\n\\nTexas Democratic Party Chairman Gilberto Hinojosa said it would be wrong to characterize progressive momentum as a “left tea party movement.” But he acknowledged a change in approach to elections from within the Democratic Party this year, with voters abandoning concerns about moderation in the primaries.\\n\\n“There’s no question that people feel we need change. That’s what this whole wave is all about,” he said. “But I don’t characterize it as an anti-establishment movement … The first thing we bring up to our party activists [is] ‘Don’t think that your candidates are going to have a better chance of getting elected because they’re middle-of-the-road candidates.’”\\n\\nHinojosa said, “We are going to party activists, to county chairs, to members of clubs, to people who are coming to our trainings, and we’re telling them, if you want to win, discard all these concerns that you had in the past about these labels and brands. You need to talk about what’s important to these people and families, and if people are branded as too progressive, so be it.”\\n\\nIdeologically, there has been little to separate many of the Democratic Party’s insurgents from their more established foes. But in profile and style, there are wide gulfs between them, marked by the high-profile victories of women and young, non-white Democrats. Their rhetoric echoes complaints made by conservative activists in 2010 about the disconnect between Washington representatives and their constituents — and about the fitness of incumbent politicians to serve.\\n\\n“We committed to running a campaign for those who don’t see themselves reflected in politics or government, and are forever told that their issues, their concerns, their priorities can wait,” Pressley told cheering supporters on Tuesday.\\n\\n“These times,” she said, “demanded more from our leaders, and from our party.”\\n\\nAnd while Pressley and Ocasio-Cortez did not carry the “Don’t Tread on Me” flag of the tea party movement, the warlike framing of the primaries have been in full effect.\\n\\nAt her victory party on Tuesday, Presley said voters understood that “with our rights under assault, with our freedoms under siege, that it’s not just good enough to see the Democrats back in power, but it matters who those Democrats are.”\\n\\n“Are you ready to bring change to Washington?” she asked, leading the crowd in chants of “Change can’t wait!”\\n\\nSal Russo, a former Reagan aide and Tea Party Express co-founder, said Wednesday that as he watched Democrats’ angst about Trump unfold last year, he initially did not see a resemblance to the tea party.\\n\\nBut a year later, Russo said, “Now there’s an agenda … Repeal the tax cut, Medicare for all and free higher education.” While maintaining that such policy positions will not resonate widely in November, he said progressive Democrats are “a lot more focused” than in 2017.\\n\\nHoward Kaloogian, another Tea Party Express co-founder and a former California state lawmaker, described the Democratic Party’s current political climate, as for Republicans in 2010, as reflecting an “anti-establishment mood,” while noting the “great dissimilarity in the direction that the anti-establishment movement is taking.”\\n\\nSo far, the force of the progressive left on the midterms has not yet fully matched the pandemonium the tea party wrought on the GOP in 2010. And many Democrats loathe the comparison.\\n\\n“This is just the base showing up,” said Michael Blake, a New York assemblyman and vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee. “This is more about a very granular, grass-roots approach in a midterm election that we haven’t seen before. … The base is not just going to show up when Obama’s on the ballot. People are ready to go.”\\n\\nWhile Democrats are recoiling from Trump, Blake said they are also animated by new causes and candidates.\\n\\n“People are genuinely excited about Ayanna,” he said. “They are genuinely excited about Andrew. They are genuinely excited about Alexandria. Being angry is not enough.”\\n\\nIn November, Blake said, “this election is going to be an opportunity to demonstrate, for the first time in a lot of ways … that people are mobilized and focused.”\\n\\nIn fact, Republicans have seized on the Democratic Party’s leftward shift, much as Democrats once sought to frame tea partyers as extremists. Rep. Ron DeSantis, Florida’s Republican candidate for governor, has whacked Ocasio-Cortez as a “socialist” — she describes herself as a “democratic socialist.”\\n\\nThe Republican Governors Association greeted Gillum’s primary victory with a statement that repeatedly referred to him as a “far-left radical.”\\n\\nAnd Trump, framing Gillum’s contest against DeSantis, amplified the point on Twitter last week, \"Not only did Congressman Ron DeSantis easily win the Republican Primary, but his opponent in November is his biggest dream ... a failed Socialist Mayor named Andrew Gillum who has allowed crime & many other problems to flourish in his city. This is not what Florida wants or needs!”\\n\\nPressley and Ocasio-Cortez are heavily favored to win election. But as with conservatives in the tea party, the test for progressive Democrats more broadly is to extend their appeal beyond base primary voters — and, if successful, remake the Democratic establishment in their image.\\n\\n“The question is, can the Democrats sustain this and can they govern with new faces in a very disparate and diffuse party,” Sheinkopf said. “If they try to govern, their coalition is going to be very difficult to manage … The rules with which we normally define American politics are changing.”\\n\\nIn his concession speech Tuesday, Capuano acknowledged the shifting winds within the party — and the disillusionment catching incumbent Democrats in its wake.\\n\\n“Clearly, the district wanted a lot of change,” he said. “Apparently the district just is very upset with lots of things that are going on. I don’t blame them. I’m just as upset as they are.”\\n\\nHe added, “So be it. This is the way life goes.”\\n\\n', 'clickbait': array(['1'], dtype='<U1')}\n",

Tom Carper faces a challenge from Kerri Harris, part of a movement of progressive primary challengers.\\n\\nWILMINGTON, Del. — Liberal insurgents have toppled two 20-year House members in Democratic primaries this year. Now, they are setting their sights on the Senate, where pro-business Delaware Sen. Tom Carper faces his first serious primary challenge in decades.\\n\\nCarper has been in statewide elected office for four decades — longer than his challenger, Kerri Evelyn Harris, has been alive. And though Delaware has transformed from a political battleground to a reliably blue state in that time, Carper’s long moderate record has made him vulnerable to criticism from the left ahead of Thursday's primary. Harris, a 38-year-old Air Force veteran, has slammed Carper for a voting record that she says is too friendly toward banks and pharmaceutical companies, and too hostile toward the environment.\\n\\nStory Continued Below\\n\\nBut, most of all, Harris — a biracial lesbian who is trying to be the first successful primary challenger of a Democratic senator since 2010 — says Carper and other political leaders are out of touch with everyday Delawareans.\\n\\n“They tell us time and time again how to fix our community. But they’re never there,” Harris said at an event at a community center here last week with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the would-be leader of the anti-incumbent movement who ousted Rep. Joe Crowley (D-N.Y.) in a primary back in June. “They show up, take a picture and go home.”\\n\\nCarper — like his one-time Senate colleague, former Vice President Joe Biden — commutes daily on Amtrak trains between here and Washington. He was on Capitol Hill on both Tuesday and Wednesday this week, according to roll call votes taken each day.\\n\\nBut Carper says he isn’t going to be caught flat-footed by Harris’ challenge.\\n\\n“For as long as I can remember, I’ve campaigned as if I were 20 points behind — every race — and as if my opponents were 10 feet tall. And I’m certainly doing that here,” Carper said last week. “We’re ready.”\\n\\nCarper is in many ways a throwback to another era. His move from the House to the governor’s office was smoothed by “the swap,” when he and then-GOP Gov. Mike Castle each ran for the other’s job in the 1992 election. Yard signs for Carper’s candidacy are tagged with the slogan “Today More Than Ever,” which evokes then-President Richard Nixon’s reelection catchphrase in 1972.\\n\\nBut Carper is now trying to beat back a progressive rebellion bent on replacing Democrats like himself with younger firebrands. The movement has already claimed two 10-term House Democratic incumbents. The latest, Rep. Mike Capuano (D-Mass.), was soundly defeated this week by Ayanna Pressley, a City Council member in Boston.\\n\\nPressley and Ocasio-Cortez are women of color, like Harris — while Capuano and Crowley, like Carper, are older, white men.\\n\\nHarris has the backing of the same constellation of left-wing groups that have backed other liberal revolutionaries: Democracy for America, Justice Democrats, the Working Families Party and Our Revolution, the nonprofit spinoff of Sen. Bernie Sanders’ 2016 presidential campaign.\\n\\nThese groups understand the significance of ousting a Senate incumbent. “If Kerri wins, this is bigger than Ocasio-Cortez. It’s going to be huge,” said Nasim Thompson of Justice Democrats. “It would be unseating a long-term senator. It’s going to reverberate just like, if not more than, Ocasio-Cortez.”\\n\\nMorning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign — weekday mornings, in your inbox.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\\n\\nIn addition to unseating Capuano and Crowley, progressives have notched some high-profile wins in open races this year, like Andrew Gillum’s victory in last month’s Florida gubernatorial primary. But they’ve also come up short in a number of other contests, like Abdul el-Sayed’s unsuccessful campaign for governor in Michigan, or the failure to unseat Illinois Rep. Dan Lipinski, an anti-abortion incumbent who represents a Democratic, Chicagoland seat.\\n\\nHarris’ policy breaks with Carper mostly come from the left. She criticized him for voting for the Keystone Pipeline and backing offshore drilling (though he opposes it off the Delaware coast). She says his ties to pharmaceutical companies haven’t helped Delaware cope with the opioid crisis.\\n\\nOn criminal justice issues, Harris faults Carper for mass incarceration dating back to his gubernatorial tenure in the 1990s. “My opponent prides himself in having been tough on crime while he was governor,” Harris said at the event. “The biggest prison expansion happened his watch. More blacks and low-income white people are in prison today than ever because of that expansion. You can’t show up and pretend that you care when you’re destroying our families.”\\n\\nHarris also checks off a litany of other liberal goals: Medicare-for-all, raising the federal minimum wage to $15, universal pre-kindergarten and using government funds to eliminate student debt.\\n\\nDemocratic insiders are skeptical of Harris’ chances. “She started late,” said Rhett Ruggerio, a former Democratic National Committee member and top aide to former Wilmington Mayor James Baker. “If this race was a month from now, we might be having a different conversation.”\\n\\nBut both Ruggerio and Harris’ allies say that Delaware’s small size — fewer than 64,000 votes were cast in the 2016 Democratic primary for an open congressional seat — give the challenger a chance.\\n\\n“Delaware is small, so the universe [of voters] is small,” said Ruggerio. “And when the universe is small, you’re vulnerable.”\\n\\nDemocracy for America’s Yvette Simpson agreed.\\n\\n“Delaware is small enough that you can build relationships through engagement, through being on the ground, working hard, talking voters and getting them to get out,” she said. “You can win a Senate race in Delaware, versus another state that’s larger.”\\n\\nIn a Q-and-A with reporters after the event here last week, Harris and Ocasio-Cortez both worked to cast the Delaware race in national terms. Ocasio-Cortez said the Delaware race is “part of a broader message and a broader movement of social change” that has seen her crisscross the country in support of other Democratic candidates, even though she was little-known until June, and she still faces a general election in New York in November.\\n\\n“Win or lose, none of these races have been failures,” agreed Harris. “You think 2018 is seeing insurgent candidates? You wait for 2020, 2024. We’re going to keep going — bigger, bigger, bigger.”\\n\\nJames Arkin reported from Washington.

In the end he went with the guy he knew and trusted best: Chris King.\\n\\nGillum and King, an Orlando businessman who came in fourth place in the Democratic primary for governor, became good friends on the campaign trail, never attacking each other at debates as each vied for the unofficial title of best orator and progressive champion, making their ticket the most liberal Democratic ticket in Florida history.\\n\\nStory Continued Below\\n\\nAt one point, when both were vying for third and fourth place in the primary, they had a secret meeting to discuss combining forces on a joint ticket. But neither wanted to be the No. 2.\\n\\n“What this race is going to be about is where we want to go as a state. Not where we’ve been.

But in trying to beat him, he beat me pretty badly. But I came to care for him. And I came to admire him — his gifts. his talents, and most importantly his vision.”\\n\\nIn picking King, Gillum opted against the conventional wisdom that he needed a woman or an Hispanic candidate, a decision that had seemed likelier to some after Republican opponent Ron DeSantis chose as his running mate Miami state Rep. Jeanette Nuñez, the first Cuban-American woman to run as lieutenant governor.\\n\\nFlorida Playbook newsletter Our must-read briefing on what's hot, crazy or shady about politics in the Sunshine State. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\\n\\nBut Gillum has already made history as the first African-American gubernatorial nominee for the Democratic Party; his supporters say that fact reduced the pressure to have a running mate of color or a woman. And so he decided to go with his friend and not former opponent Gwen Graham, state Sen. Lauren Book or state Rep. Amy Mercado, who is of Puerto Rican descent. Gillum was still embittered by Graham’s campaign, which he blamed for engaging in a whisper campaign linking him to an FBI investigation in City Hall in Tallahassee, where he’s mayor.\\n\\nNot everyone was happy. Some wondered if King can attract voters, considering his campaign spent nearly $8 million for fewer than 36,000 votes — or 2.5 percent of the electorate, an average of $211.66 per vote. King didn’t even win his own precinct.\\n\\nOthers were concerned about the public-relations toll of an FBI investigation into City Hall, where Gillum is mayor. Gillum voluntarily met with agents without a lawyer and said he’s not a target — and no signs publicly indicate he is — but DeSantis is suggesting he’s corrupt.\\n\\nLeslie Wimes, an African-American liberal activist, wanted Gillum to pick Palm Beach County’s state attorney, Dave Aronberg, to give the candidate law enforcement cover.\\n\\n“I’m a huge Andrew Gillum supporter. I really like Chris King as well. I just don’t think King helps with the only thing Republicans are clubbing Gillum over the head with, and that’s the FBI/Ethics situation,” Wimes said in a text message to POLITICO. “A Lieutenant Governor with some law enforcement background to go with Gillum’s progressive ideas would have been spectacular.”\\n\\nBut Gillum’s campaign and top supporters say there’s only so much the lieutenant governor matters overall. And Gillum went with someone he likes, trusts and respects.\\n\\n“This is a DeSantis vs. Gillum race. When you’re picking a lieutenant governor, you shouldn’t pander,” said Juan Cuba, chairman of the Miami-Dade Democratic Party, who was hoping Gillum would select King. “Pick someone you trust and someone who’s with you on your vision and campaign relentlessly. And Chris King has shown he can crisscross the state.”\\n\\nStill, some Democrats hope that King’s pick would help Gillum in majority-white counties, which he lost to Graham. She finished second Aug. 28, followed by former Miami Beach Mayor Philip Levine and Palm Beach billionaire Jeff Greene.\\n\\nCuba credited Gillum for not playing identity politics and instead re-emphasizing the liberal message of his campaign. King shares Gillum’s politics, and the Harvard-educated debater is as articulate as he is rare: an evangelical on the political left.\\n\\nKing also gained a reputation on the campaign trail as being an unapologetic liberal who advanced new ideas and campaign messages, from promising to fight Big Sugar and never take a dime from the industry to calling for a tax on bullets to fund trauma care and school safety initiatives.\\n\\nHenry Crespo, past president of the Democratic Black Caucus of Florida, praised the pick that for the first time, has a black man at the top of the ticket and a white man as his running mate.\\n\\n“Why not have ebony and ivory? This is what it’s about,” Crespo said. “This ticket represents the future of Florida as it relates to race relations. This is a first. Black, white, evangelical, progressive, young, a young black man from an urban corridor, a young white man from the suburbs who went to Harvard.”\\n\\n\", 'clickbait': array(['0'], dtype='<U1')}\n",

The court had liberals and conservatives, and general voting patterns, but public analysis of the court’s activity normally centered on the legal reasoning behind decisions and dissents. People might disagree with one ruling or another, but the court’s overall authority, rooted in its role as a trusted arbiter of competing claims, enjoyed a basic respect.\\n\\nToday, in contrast, it’s common to regard the court as little more than another political body. More and more, Senate votes for judicial nominees, such as Brett Kavanaugh, break down along party lines, and people tend to assume that the outcome of a given case will hinge on which bloc of justices, liberal or conservative, has the majority. Justices—like everybody else in our tribal world—are now seen as vehicles for expressing a political preference.\\n\\nStory Continued Below\\n\\nIt’s not just the Supreme Court, either. Something similar is happening in all our institutions—the news media, universities, think tanks, the intelligence services and other technocratic offices of the government. Once respected as objective, neutral bodies that could referee claims emerging from our heterogeneous society, they are increasingly viewed as instruments of a liberal or conservative or other ideological agenda, if sometimes hiding their partisanship behind a veneer of disinterestedness. The very idea of value neutrality that rose to prominence after World War II—the idea that individuals or institutions can fairly arbitrate among competing values in a pluralistic society—has fallen on hard times, leaving us unsure of where to turn for a reliable account of the world.\\n\\nIt’s easy to blame Donald Trump for this shift, with his casual mendacity and contempt for conventions. He has cavalierly trashed institutions he dislikes, from CNN to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to the intelligence agencies, as tools of the opposition, encouraging his followers to dismiss their pretenses of fairness. But Trump isn’t the root of this problem so much as a poisonous flower. The cynicism he exploits and deepens has been metastasizing for decades. Now it has reached stage 4.\\n\\nWe can already see the implications: dysfunctional Washington politics, a shrill public discourse rife with accusations of bad faith, conspiracy theories sprouting like toadstools, sharp hostility to universities. The inability to marshal a national consensus even on basic facts—like the Russian efforts to disrupt our elections—has prevented us from taking steps to secure our democracy and left many fearful about the soundness of our system. Without trust in the government and other neutral bodies to provide reliable information and to adjudicate fairly among viewpoints, we risk losing one of our democracy’s greatest virtues: the ability to wage our debates freely and contentiously while knowing that ultimately most of us will accept the resolutions as legitimate. Without such acceptance, self-government becomes like a trial without a judge, a boxing match without a referee. What happened?\\n\\n\\n\\n***\\n\\nThe importance we place on neutrality in our institutions is actually somewhat new. It grew out of what the intellectual historian Edward Purcell, in the title of an influential 1973 book, called the “crisis of democratic theory,” which gripped American intellectual culture in the 1920s and ’30s. In that era, worldwide depression and a backlash against the idealism of World War I undermined the grounds for believing that democracy was necessarily the best form of government. Because philosophers and social scientists had come to embrace empiricism over rationalism—arguing that our knowledge came from experience, not reason—many intellectuals had lost their confidence in the older philosophical principles that had once seemed absolute. A relativistic outlook seeped into American culture, even affecting how people thought about democracy.\\n\\nBut in the crucible of World War II and the fight against totalitarianism, Purcell showed, there emerged a revised defense of democracy. In place of the fashionable cynicism of the 1920s and ’30s came the idea that democracy was superior as a system of government precisely because it wasn’t absolute. It allowed multiple viewpoints to coexist and compete, and it was capable of revision. Although this argument took place at a rarefied level, among scholars and intellectuals, their ideas crept into popular thought.\\n\\nTrust In Institutions According to Gallup, Americans’ trust in institutions, from newspapers to the Supreme Court to public schools, has steadily declined, reaching historic lows over the past decade. The share with a “great deal” or “quite a lot” of confidence in Congress has dropped from a high of 42 percent when the survey was first conducted in 1973 to 11 percent in 2018.\\n\\nCredit: Getty Images\\n\\nThe new understanding of democracy as experimental, like science, meant government was best seen as a neutral manager of competing interests, not an instrument for imposing an ideology. A set of ideas might prevail in a given election, but victory was provisional. Democracy, one might say, was a verb; its value consisted in continuing to enact it. “The totalitarians regard the toleration of conflict as our central weakness,” Arthur Schlesinger Jr. wrote in 1949. “But we know it to be basically our central strength.”\\n\\nThe institutions that promote and disseminate knowledge came to rest on similar assumptions. In the late 19th century, America’s great research universities arose, and the social sciences flourished by claiming to put knowledge on a more scientific, empirical basis. Similarly, as early as the 1890s, newspaper journalism had come to value factual reporting over editorializing; by the 1920s, objectivity and commitment to facts were understood as helpful ways to avoid the pitfalls of the subjective. In the years after World War II, these tendencies settled into guiding principles. These institutions promoted inquiry, fairness, openness and the competition of ideas.\\n\\nThe post-war decades were hardly free of turmoil, from McCarthyism to the struggles for racial equality. But with the far right and far left in retreat, President John F. Kennedy could proclaim, as he did in 1962, that “the central domestic issues of our time … relate not to basic clashes of philosophy or ideology but to ways and means of reaching common goals—to research for sophisticated solutions to complex and obstinate issues.” Widely shared prosperity and a strong social consensus backing a liberal welfare state and an internationalist foreign policy helped Americans to trust in their political system.\\n\\nBy the late 1960s, however, the consensus that had prevailed was crumbling. Left and right alike made war on established authority. From both sides, one heard the same charge: that the ostensible neutrality of the government and other public institutions masked an ideology—one that was either aggressively liberal (according to the right) or cravenly conservative (according to the left).\\n\\nProfessional expertise came under fire. As Michael Schudson wrote in the book Discovering the News: “Critics claimed that urban planning created slums, that schools made people stupid, that medicine caused disease, that psychiatry invented mental illness, and that the courts promoted injustice.” Journalistic objectivity was now disdained not as an unattainable ideal, as it had been in the past, but as “a mystification,” in Schudson’s apt term. In academia, too, arguments against politicizing scholarship faced counterclaims that all scholarship was inherently politicized. Trust in government plummeted from its peak in the mid-1960s.\\n\\nEver since, intellectuals, journalists, civil servants and others have wrestled with questions of neutrality and bias. The awareness that scholars or judges might harbor a latent ideology didn’t, for the most part, keep them from aiming for objectivity. But in the academy—and in the wider culture—it fed the growth of what became known as postmodern thought. In journalism, dissatisfaction with the strictures of “straight news” encouraged a variety of innovations, including interpretive and analytical pieces, investigative reporting and the often-subjective New Journalism. Still, these early doubts about the professed neutrality of our knowledge-forming institutions did not fatally undermine them. Postmodern critiques of scholarly values were more often mocked than embraced. Objectivity remained a respected ideal.\\n\\nIt’s hard to say when the rejection of neutrality went from being a persistent intellectual critique to a dominant belief—or even whether it’s reached that point yet. But the battle in late 2000 over the outcome of the presidential election was a symbolic watershed. That the Supreme Court voted 5-4 along ideological lines to make George W. Bush president deepened the suspicion that not only ostensibly neutral election processes but even the law itself would succumb to the political preferences of those administering it. In his dissent, Justice John Paul Stevens warned that “the loser” in that drama was “the Nation’s confidence in the judge as an impartial guardian of the rule of law.”\\n\\nUnder Bush, the polarization that had already begun to seize Washington politics intensified, dealing body blows to neutrality. Since Richard Nixon’s presidency, Republicans had gradually built a conservative counterestablishment: think tanks, foundations, societies, networks and news outlets to promote their ideas. By Bush’s presidency, it was possible to find “experts” who could lend a patina of authority to conservative policy positions otherwise unsupported by solid research—whether on evolution, birth control, global warming or even the origins of the universe. Even Bush’s most controversial undertaking, the invasion of Iraq, relied on an alternative set of intelligence analysts, after those at the CIA and elsewhere failed to return the findings that Bush had hoped for.\\n\\nFox News was crucial to this development. Founded in 1996 by the longtime Republican consultant Roger Ailes, it gained influence in the Bush years—especially after the 9/11 terrorist attacks—and wooed viewers away from what were now being called the mainstream media. But Fox’s claim of being an ideological alternative to the networks was misleading. Those networks aspired to neutrality; they weren’t trying to advance liberal causes (even if some perceived bias in their reports). Fox, despite claiming to be “fair and balanced,” reflected the pronounced ideological agenda of the man who ran it—a thoroughgoing conservative cultural populist. So liberals began to emulate the right’s methods. MSNBC began to turn itself—if half-heartedly—into a liberal Fox. And if Air America tried (and failed) to be the mirror of Rush Limbaugh, many podcasts are now succeeding at the task.\\n\\nSo, too, with think tanks. Conservative shops like the Heritage Foundation might have fancied themselves right-wing counterweights to “liberal” ones like the Brookings Institution, but Brookings, like the network news shows, adhered to a neutral scholarly ideal. Lacking a Heritage of their own, Democrats in 2003 founded the Center for American Progress, with a pronounced partisan orientation. Now, key sources of information bear a partisan stamp, undermining their claims to independent authority.\\n\\n\\n\\n***\\n\\nUnder Trump, neutrality has become a difficult position for any individual or institution to maintain. Everyone is expected to take a side. Even attempts to articulate safe, bipartisan points of consensus run afoul of tribal suspicions. Journalists who serve up anodyne platitudes about a free press suddenly seem like militant anti-Trumpers, while commonsense pleas from no less than Barack Obama not to ignore someone’s ideas solely on the basis of his race or sex are mocked as wrongheaded or naive. Where the early internet, with its blogs and comments, had put pressure on the mainstream media, social media have amplified that pressure many times over—with Twitter enticing officially neutral reporters into staking out positions, voiced with sarcasm, snark or notes of partisanship that would be verboten in the news pages. No sooner does someone try to set up a new kind of neutral arbiter—like the invaluable fact-checking sites PolitiFact and FactCheck.org—than that, too, comes under fire for bias, as these sites have from the right. PolitiFact founder Bill Adair is trying to create an automated tool that conservatives will accept as neutral—though allegations that Facebook’s algorithms are politically skewed suggest that not even a computer program can attain that holy status anymore.\\n\\nOn campuses, departments now offer courses in “social justice,” which usually means the advocacy of left-wing politics, and university presidents feel pressure to take liberal political stands. Republicans no longer consider universities forces for good. In law, opposition is growing to widely respected concepts like viewpoint-neutrality—the idea that the government can’t punish speech based on its content. Even legal scholars on the left, as the New York Times’ Adam Liptak wrote, “have traded an absolutist commitment to free speech for one sensitive to the harms it can inflict.” The First Amendment, in some eyes, isn’t really neutral anymore.\\n\\nThe demise of neutrality lies behind the dominant political problems of our age. It is responsible for all the chatter about a “post-truth society” that we have heard lately. Truth still exists, of course, but agreement on the truth feels more elusive than it has in a long time. That spells danger for democracy, which depends on constructive argument and deliberation. Without trusted sources of information or respected vehicles of settling differences, there is only partisan argument and the triumph of the powerful.\\n\\nThe collapse of neutral institutions also feeds a vicious cycle of polarization and extremism. When institutions no longer enjoy credibility across the political spectrum, people look to more ideological sources for confirmation of what they want to believe. Conservatives drift toward the Tea Party and Trump, and progressives toward left-wing radicalism. Some long-standing neutral institutions, particularly in journalism, seem to be feeling pressure to abandon their historic role in order to please their audiences. If a reporter or scholar or judge isn’t anticipating good-faith critiques from a range of viewpoints, he is less likely to shore up his thinking to make his conclusions broadly palatable.\\n\\nWhen we anticipate the future, we usually project trends to continue—and that promises a long dark night of discord. But it’s also conceivable that the Trump presidency, with its ceaseless chaos and disruption, will prompt a recognition of what is being lost and fuel demand for a rebirth of statesmanship and objectivity. In the 1930s and ’40s, it wasn’t just the threat of totalitarianism but its lure—to those frustrated with the imperfections of democracy—that forced Americans to justify their democracy in more durable ways. The current crisis is forcing us to examine the intellectual and practical bases of our system. With luck, we will, in seeing its weaknesses, have the wisdom to figure out how to shore it up.\\n\\nLet’s just hope that this time, it won’t take a world war to change our minds.\\n\\nDavid Greenberg is a professor of history and media studies at Rutgers, and author of Republic of Spin: An Inside History of the American Presidency.', 'clickbait': array(['1'], dtype='<U1')}\n",

Americans are taught, from an early age, to venerate the 231-year-old document, which occupies what can only be described as a shrine at the National Archives. The presidency of Donald Trump illustrates the problem with this veneration. It is not that Trump lacks for critics, but that the Constitution does. Not enough people connect the dots between our political dysfunctions and the sacred Constitution of 1787.\\n\\nThe most obvious problem is the Electoral College, the system by which a minority of voters can elect a president. It remains in force not because We the People like it—every poll since 1944 has shown that to be false—but rather because Article V makes ours probably the hardest constitution in the world to amend.\\n\\nStory Continued Below\\n\\nIt also makes a president nearly impossible to remove. In modern parliamentary systems, an unfit or failing prime minister can be removed once clear problems emerge, but according to the Constitution, it takes first impeachment by the House and then a two-thirds vote of an already undemocratic Senate. One doesn’t necessarily have to look abroad for potentially more attractive models; Wisconsin and California, for example, allow the electorate to recall governors in whom they have lost faith.\\n\\nThe Constitution’s dysfunction extends far beyond any individual president. Thanks to its variety of “veto gates,” the document makes it nearly impossible to pass legislation truly meeting the problems facing the country. This is why presidents of both parties, disgusted by Congress, have pushed the envelope of executive power to do what they think best. Many Americans are rightly perturbed by Trump’s claim of near-dictatorial powers with regard to mobilization of the American military, control of immigration or the imposition of tariffs against one and all countries around the world. The text of the Constitution is maddeningly vague on some of these points. And if a non-supine Congress actually did attempt to rein in the president by limiting powers it has delegated to him, the Constitution gives him veto power over any such legislation—and it would take two-thirds of each house of Congress to override such a veto. Of the approximately 2,500 veto contests over our history, presidents have won about 95 percent of them. As written, the Constitution is essentially rigged in the president’s favor.\\n\\nThe Constitution has its errors of omission as well. In almost no American state would we be debating whether the governor could fire an attorney general investigating the governor’s own misbehavior. They couldn’t—because most states do not allow governors to appoint (or to fire) attorneys general. The national Constitution, however, relies only on the character and judgment of a president to honor the independence of the attorney general and the Department of Justice.\\n\\nThe Framers simply didn’t anticipate how deeply partisanship would hollow out Congress’ willingness to hold a president accountable. They hated political parties—George Washington bemoaned “the demon of party spirit”—and failed to account for the ways in which what they called “factions” would eventually come to make a mockery of the checks and balances they wrote into the system.\\n\\nThe bitter truth is that Donald Trump’s presidency is a Frankenstein’s monster in part created by the Constitution itself, and sustained by a political class wrongly taught to worship as scripture a document whose deep flaws are becoming clearer by the day. The Constitution’s authors rose to the occasion of what one of them in 1787 described as an “imbecilic” political system to offer a radically redesigned substitute. One need not believe that their substitute has been an utter failure in order to believe that we best honor the Framers, after 231 years, by emulating their own decision to engage in what Alexander Hamilton, writing in Federalist No. 1, described as “reflection and choice” about whether our 18th-century Constitution serves us well today.\\n\\nSanford V.

The rule \"may result in extending detention of some minors and their accompanied parent or legal guardian in [family detention centers] beyond 20 days,\" the DHS document said. But the judge overseeing the Flores agreement — Los Angeles-based U.S. District Court Judge Dolly Gee — has indicated already that minors may be held longer than 20 days if the government secures their parents\\' consent.\\n\\nThe regulatory move won’t lead to any immediate change in the custody and care of migrant families or unaccompanied children, and likely will be subject to months of scrutiny during the regulatory process.\\n\\nIn addition, the proposal could face challenges in court. In July, Gee rejected a Trump administration request to detain families together. The judge specifically cited the administration’s desire to place children in unlicensed facilities, a snag the proposed regulation aims to resolve.\\n\\nIf implemented, such a regulation, coupled with adequate funding, could allow President Donald Trump to reinstate a “zero tolerance” enforcement policy toward families arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border.\\n\\nUnder the policy, which was fully put into effect in early May, DHS referred all suspected border crossers — including families and asylum seekers — for federal prosecution. As parents faced prosecution, thousands of children were rendered “unaccompanied minors” and placed in federal facilities around the country.\\n\\nAmid widespread public backlash over family separations, Trump issued an executive order in June that ordered families be detained together. However, the administration lacked the legal authority and resources to detain children with their parents for extended periods, which meant Trump’s order effectively neutralized “zero tolerance” for families.\\n\\nThe notice of proposed rulemaking will be issued Friday by DHS and HHS.\\n\\nThis article tagged under: Immigration\\n\\nSeparated Families', 'clickbait': array(['0'], dtype='<U1')}\n",

That much is clear. But much of the rest of what the DOJ is doing is a mystery, people in the industry say, including whether the outreach to state attorneys general is bipartisan and whether the DOJ envisions any avenue for applying competition law to questions of partisan discrimination.\\n\\nThe DOJ dropped its notice in between a Senate hearing on election security featuring Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, and a House hearing on alleged bias featuring Dorsey alone. The DOJ said in its statement that it had \"listened ... closely\" to the Senate session, a somewhat confusing note given that bias hardly came up during that hearing.\\n\\nA DOJ source said the session with Sessions and the local officials is set to take place Sept. 25, and had been scheduled before the hearing to address the attorney general\\'s longstanding concerns.\\n\\nCarl Szabo, vice president and general counsel of the trade association NetChoice, said that his fellow conservatives\\' push for more oversight of digital platforms is ill-conceived.\\n\\n\"Conservative values are centered around the idea that businesses should be allowed to do what they think is best for their customers, and that\\'s exactly what these companies are doing,\" said Szabo. Facebook and Google are members of NetChoice.\\n\\nAsked what sort of legal argument about competition Sessions might be making, \"It doesn\\'t make any sense to me,\" said Szabo, a former Federal Trade Commission official on the staff of Republican Orson Swindle.\\n\\nSessions\\' outreach to state attorneys general is significant — many of the regulatory actions taken against the tech industry in recent years have happened on the local level. California recently passed a set of privacy rules widely opposed by the industry, and Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley, a Republican, has announced that he\\'s investigating Google on antitrust and privacy grounds.\\n\\nSaid Hawley at the time, “I will not let Missouri consumers and businesses be exploited by industry giants.”\\n\\nDorsey got a question about the DOJ\\'s surprise announcement during Wednesday afternoon\\'s hearing. Florida Democratic Rep. Kathy Castor asked whether the Twitter CEO felt like he was the target of a \"manipulation campaign,\" especially when the DOJ action comes amid Republican fundraising efforts off the bias complaints.\\n\\n\"Now the Justice Department even says, \\'Boy, this is so serious that we have to investigate it,\\'\" Castor said.\\n\\nDorsey didn\\'t take the bait, saying he appreciated concerns about the platform he heads.\\n\\n\"That\\'s a very diplomatic answer, I have to say,\" Castor shot back.\\n\\nDemocratic lawmakers, though, were quick to say that the huge amount of attention Republicans are paying to alleged social media bias is little more than political grandstanding.\\n\\n“As reported in the news, the Trump campaign and the Republican majority leader have used the supposed anti-conservative bias online to fundraise,\" said New Jersey Rep. Frank Pallone, the top-ranking Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. \"This hearing appears to be just one more mechanism to raise money and generate outrage. It appears Republicans are desperately trying to rally their base by fabricating a problem that simply does not exist.”\\n\\nDorsey found himself in a tight spot throughout his day on Capitol Hill. Complaints that Twitter was meddling with conservative tweets were mixed with calls for him to help improve the quality of public discussions that take place on Twitter.\\n\\nIn pushing back against complaints of bias, many in the tech industry argue that social media has actually been a boon to conservatives. The Tea Party first found traction there, they point out, and Trump is among its most prominent users.\\n\\nTrump, in fact, often turns to Twitter to voice his complaints about his own administration, including Sessions. On Monday, for example, Trump mocked Sessions for recently bringing charges against two Republican members of Congress shortly before the mid-term elections that will determine the control of Congress. \"Good job Jeff......

Demers.\\n\\nStory Continued Below\\n\\nIn addition to Udall, the letter was signed by Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) and Dick Durbin (D-Ill.).\\n\\nIn response to the letter, Giuliani told POLITICO in a text \"nothing done to influence U.S. government ever. Do they think I\\'m a fool like them. All of it security and law enforcement.\" Giuliani added that none of his work \"implicates FARA.\"\\n\\nThe letter comes after POLITICO and other news outlets reported last week that Giuliani received a fee from Freeh Group International Solutions, run by Clinton FBI Director Louis Freeh, for a letter he sent to the president of Romania in August that criticized the country’s anti-corruption measures. Giuliani’s position in his letter contradicted that of the State Department.\\n\\n“This activity raises both the question of whether Mr. Giuliani may have attempted to influence U.S. policy and what the U.S. government\\'s true position is, given his role as the President’s personal attorney and public spokesman,” the senators wrote, in reference to the letter to the Romanian president.\\n\\nThe most reliable politics newsletter.

It’s unclear who the Freeh Group is working for.\\n\\nIn addition to his work for the Freeh Group, Giuliani has also worked on behalf of clients in Brazil and Colombia, and has represented Mujahedeen-e-Khalq, or MEK, an Iranian resistance group, according to The Washington Post. In Wednesday’s letter, the senators write that Giuliani is mentioned “in nearly every article” describing MEK’s lobbying effort to be removed from the State Department’s Foreign Terrorist Organization list.\\n\\n“Given Mr. Giuliani’s receipt of significant payment from the MEK and simultaneous advocacy on behalf of that group and its objectives, his actions may require registration under FARA,” the senators wrote.\\n\\nThe letter comes at a time when there is substantial scrutiny around foreign lobbying, as former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort goes to trial this month for allegedly failing to register as a foreign agent for lobbying work he did on behalf of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych and his political allies, among other allegations.\\n\\nMembers of Congress have also recently introduced legislation to crack down on foreign lobbying. Warren introduced a bill in August that would stop Americans from lobbying on behalf of foreign governments and companies. In addition, Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Rep.

Guajardo returned to Mexico City over the weekend, and Mexican officials have said they stand ready to return to Washington for any remaining talks when needed.\\n\\nTrudeau, however, appeared to be undeterred by the timeline, making clear this week that Canada would not give in on at least two demands: that a final deal preserve a dispute process that allows Canada to challenge U.S. tariffs and allow Canada to block U.S. companies from taking over its media industry.\\n\\n“We need to keep the Chapter 19 dispute resolution because that ensures that the rules are actually followed, and we know that we have a president that doesn’t always follow the rules as they’re laid out,” Trudeau said, referring to a dispute process that allows Canada to try to overturn U.S. anti-dumping and countervailing duties that they believe were unfairly applied.\\n\\nSign up for Morning Trade A speed read on global trade news — weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Ottawa has aggressively used the process against U.S. decisions on softwood lumber imports. The Trump administration wants to eliminate it, arguing that it weakens the ability of the U.S. to defend itself against unfairly traded goods.\\n\\nTrudeau also said a revamped NAFTA deal must preserve Canada’s ability to protect its “cultural industries” by blocking the purchase of Canadian television stations or networks by U.S. companies.\\n\\n“It would be a giving up of our sovereignty and identity and that is something that we simply will not accept,” he said.\\n\\nBeyond those topics, the U.S. is pressing Canada on a number of other areas where concessions could be politically difficult.\\n\\nTrump himself has raised the issue of Canada’s dairy import restrictions as a major target. U.S. dairy farmers want to walk away with a deal that expands access to the Canadian market, where imports are restricted under a politically sensitive program meant to protect farmer incomes.\\n\\nU.S. producers also want Canada to get rid of an ingredient program that effectively blocked their ability to export ultrafiltered milk, a popular new dairy product used in cheese production that was not subject to Canadian tariffs or quotas.\\n\\nAgriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said Canada should be “willing to acknowledge” that the program was not in the spirit of the original NAFTA deal, adding that the U.S. wants it ended. “I think we’ll get that done,” he said Wednesday.\\n\\nDairy is an issue where Canada has “shown a certain amount of flexibility,” Trudeau said, but he stressed that the nation would defend its supply management system. “We have red lines that Canadians simply will not accept,” he said.\\n\\nThe U.S. is also demanding that NAFTA countries lengthen its copyright term to the life of the author plus 70 years. Canada currently has a term that extends for the life of the author plus 50 years. Ottawa had agreed to the longer term when it signed the Trans-Pacific Partnership, but Canada didn’t have to change its law after the provision was suspended after Trump pulled out of the Asia-Pacific pact.\\n\\nThe U.S. and Mexico also agreed to bolster patent safeguards for a new class of biological drugs by establishing a 10-year protection period. Canada, which has a national health care system, only provides eight years of protection before cheaper, generic versions of the drugs can be produced.\\n\\nBusiness groups are pressing against Trump’s insistence that there is “no political necessity” to keep Canada in the deal. Republicans and Democrats as well as labor groups have all been united in their demand that NAFTA remain a three-way deal.\\n\\n“If you break off one member of this agreement, you break it all, and that would be bad news for U.S. businesses, for American jobs, and for economic growth,” U.S. Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Thomas Donohue said. “Anything other than a trilateral agreement won’t win congressional approval and would lose business support.”\\n\\nStill, there was some hope that the two countries could eventually hash out a deal.\\n\\nStephen Moore, an economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation who is close to the White House after serving as an economic adviser to the campaign, said Wednesday that a deal with Canada will likely be reached in the coming weeks.\\n\\n“I think that the Mexican agreement is a pretty good start,” Moore said at a Senate hearing on Capitol Hill. “I think we’re going to get an agreement in the next few weeks with Canada.”\\n\\nMegan Cassella and Ryan McCrimmon contributed to this report.', 'clickbait': array(['0'], dtype='<U1')}\n",

During the Kavanaugh hearing, liberals walked right in.\\n\\nIt’s not easy to set a new standard for stupid in 2018, but a few left-wingers on Twitter managed it during Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings.\\n\\nLess discerning viewers wouldn’t have noticed the moment at all. During the interminable opening session of the hearings on Tuesday, Zina Bash, a former Trump White House aide who once clerked for Judge Kavanaugh, sat behind the nominee, visible in the camera shot, with one hand at rest in a gesture that looked vaguely like an “OK” signal.\\n\\nStory Continued Below\\n\\nThe gesture was declared a white-power symbol and “a national outrage” by a #resistance tweeter who has 200,000 followers. The activist and author Amy Siskind said the supposed gesture alone should disqualify Kavanaugh from the Supreme Court. (She deleted the tweet but still maintained that she couldn’t tell whether Bash’s hand was in a natural position or represented something more nefarious.) Liberal stalwart Chris Hayes tried to dismiss the controversy and was slapped down by a ThinkProgress writer.\\n\\nIt was quickly pointed out how insane the hand-signal theory was. As Bash’s husband explained, his Mexican-born wife is Mexican on her mother’s side and Jewish on her father’s side, and her grandparents survived the Holocaust. She is a most unlikely secret convert to the alt-right.\\n\\nAnd indeed, the whole idea that the OK sign is a white-power signal — the fingers secretly representing a “W” for white and a “P” for power — is a hoax. The idea was pushed by internet trolls to fool credulous liberals into picking it up. Mission accomplished.\\n\\nIt’s not clear how the hand-signal theory was supposed to make sense at all. If Kavanaugh is a stealth white-power candidate for the Supreme Court, why would someone on his side go out of her way to advertise that fact on national TV? And if Kavanaugh is a brazen white-power candidate, why would a supporter rely on such a subtle gesture to signal his true colors?\\n\\nThe mind struggles to imagine the intended audience for such a gesture. A racist underground initiated in a series of secret symbols and handshakes that would suddenly be activated to lend its full support for Kavanaugh? Or did Bash supposedly make plain her racism just for the hell of it, to prove that she could get away with it?\\n\\nWho knows, and who cares? What it actually signals is that for an element of the left, the Trump era has been an open invitation to lose their minds — one they have gladly accepted for fun and profit, since there are few things said about the president that can be too extreme or irrational to find an audience.\\n\\nIn one sense this is typical. The natural idiom of the out-party in American politics is suspicion of, verging on paranoia about, the party in power, which is almost always considered alien, corrupt and despotic.\\n\\nBut the left is also in the grips of a feeling of inflamed impotence, especially when it comes to the Supreme Court. The Democrats couldn’t confirm Barack Obama’s pick, Merrick Garland, for the late Antonin Scalia’s seat, yet President Donald Trump has two high court picks and counting. These seats, by their reckoning, are therefore “stolen” — although their disposition was subject to normal democratic processes. The Democrats could have had control of all the Supreme Court picks over the past several years if they’d managed to hold the Senate in 2014, or the presidency in 2016. They could do neither. Procedural theatrics, hearing-room protests and outrageous allegations are all they have to substitute for their lack of power.\\n\\nBut it runs deeper than that. The left’s racial theory of America is basically a conspiracy theory. It believes in a deeply embedded, all-pervasive white supremacy. Everyone on the right is a budding Richard Spencer. Even Brett Kavanaugh, as credentialed and establishment a figure as you can find, is a suspected vehicle for racism.\\n\\nIn fairness, Trump has done almost nothing to try to allay the fears about him the way a traditional politician would. Rather, he devotes great time and energy to provoking the other side. Driving his opposition yet more bonkers might well serve his interests in a 2020 reelection campaign — but in the meantime unhinged people have a more and more prominent place in our public life.\\n\\nThe new standard for stupid in 2018 isn’t much of a landmark, because it will be eclipsed soon enough.\\n\\nRich Lowry is editor of National Review and a contributing editor with Politico Magazine.\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'clickbait': array(['1'], dtype='<U1')}\n",

Here’s What Would Really Drive Trump Nuts. Don’t feed the beast. Starve him of the attention he so desperately craves.\\n\\nAh, yes, just in time for the end of beach leisure after Labor Day. Another insider account of life in the White House by the celebrated Bob Woodward.\\n\\nThe book isn’t even officially out yet, and already, the gnashing and snarling are erupting as various top administration officials claim never to have said words attributed to them by the Pulitzer Prize-winning author. Including the president, who’s slamming Woodward’s Fear as a “bad book.” Same as it ever was.\\n\\nStory Continued Below\\n\\nWoodward is a smart and clever writer, and his books — he’s written nearly two dozen of them — often shed light on how the modern presidency works and sometimes doesn’t. He captures scenes and conversations that have real impact on how we understand a precious institution, the presidency, that are always worthy of study and explanation.\\n\\nNo one should mistake his work, however, for “journalism” or “history.” It will take many years for experts in those disciplines to unravel what really has happened in this odd and uniquely dysfunctional White House.\\n\\nWoodward provides an immediate alternative. He interrogates various actors, sometimes giving them the cloak of anonymity, and then weaves together his best approximation of how real events may have unfolded. His technique includes providing quotation marks around conversations where he was not present and where the participants presumably offer their best recollection of how unrecorded conversations unfolded. (Here’s an exercise to try: Can you remember exact quotes from that heated office meeting you had a couple months ago about next year’s budget? How sure are you that you got them exactly right?)\\n\\nI’ve been involved in some of Bob’s books about my time in the Clinton White House and have scowled and chafed at the representation made of some of my encounters. I even challenged Bob once to make a verbatim transcript available of our “interview” but he slyly told me the best stuff I gave him was when the recorder was off and I had a glass of wine or two during an encounter we had in Aspen, Colorado. Oh well — maybe he was right about that. But I don’t think so.\\n\\nWoodward transacts in a genre we should appreciate as “historical fiction” — a literary form consisting of narratives that take place in the past and are characterized by an imaginative reconstruction of historical events and personages. Our culture is full of great examples of how valuable this genre can be. Go see “Hamilton” if you doubt it.\\n\\nBut appreciate Woodward for what he gives us and does not. He is not giving us a literal record of what has been happening behind closed doors at the White House. He gives us a very important approximation of things that may have happened as he imagines them, and as his anonymous sources recall and spin them. And that is enough to strike some “Fear” in all of us. I just pre-ordered my copy on Amazon and it will surely be a best-seller. As the inevitable debate kicks off about who said what when, let’s remember what this project is really about.\\n\\nThink of Woodward’s account as a rough first draft of history. The book will contribute to learning the truth even when Trump’s PR people say “the truth isn’t truth.” Does anyone doubt that, particulars aside, it portrays the larger story of this presidency accurately?\\n\\nThat said, I’m not sure another inside-baseball book is what America really needed. Faced with ever more damning stories and sinking approval ratings, Trump is now musing openly about yanking broadcast licenses, changing libel laws and escalating his regular attacks on the “enemy of the people” — language that would be right at home in the Soviet Union. Journalists may scoff at his ability to follow through on his Twitter threats, but they underestimate his intentions at their peril. Trump has declared war on the press, and it’s time for the press to fight fire with fire.\\n\\nOr better yet, fight fire with water. How about changing the rules of engagement, especially in reporting by White House reporters? How about this alternative: Let’s declare a month of “Trump-free” journalism. No live coverage of meaningless photo opportunities. No endless repeats of silly tweets. How about no one shows up for Sarah Sanders’ White House press briefings given that they are largely useless anyhow? How about no mention of Trump on shows like “Morning Joe” for at least a week?\\n\\nDeny Trump the oxygen he most wants and needs. Daily coverage. Take him off the air. Tell all those very talented journalists at the White House to go out and cover what this administration is really doing. Daily coverage at the Agriculture Department or the Department of Homeland Security. Real reports from the Environmental Protection Agency. On the front page. With no “Trump” in any headline.\\n\\nI’m as eager to scoop up every morsel of palace intrigue from inside this “crazytown” White House as everyone else. But there is a better way for the press to win this war. They need to get the people on their side. They need to demonstrate that their first interest is the public’s right to know and that they are willing to fight back. This will be contrary to every instinct that journalists have in normal times. But these are not them. The rules of engagement need to change.\\n\\nMike McCurry is former White House press secretary to President Bill Clinton and professor and director at the Center for Public Theology at Wesley Theological Seminary in Washington, D.C.', 'clickbait': array(['1'], dtype='<U1')}\n",

Trump is hardly anyone’s model of an “ideas man”—he doesn’t appear to read books, and his favored policies are a mashup of promises and threats drawn almost at random from the past two centuries of American thought.\\n\\nAnd yet: The man’s political project has remade the intellectual landscape of his own party and forced a desperate reassessment in the other. Trump has expanded policy horizons on the right to include approaches to economic protectionism and immigration that went out of fashion sometime around the Hoover administration, while in the Democratic Party his ascendancy has inspired not just earnest soul-searching on the part of its “establishment” wing but a four-alarm-fire response from its activist base and policy wonks.\\n\\nStory Continued Below\\n\\nThe American policy debate today feels more expansive than it’s been at any point since the height of the Great Depression, when business-driven isolationists, rural populists and open communists vied for elbow room amid the breakdown of a crumbling Gilded Age status quo. It’s easy to see the parallels to now, as the Trump presidency’s never-ending shock waves wake those in the American establishment, whether they like it or not, from the so-called “end of history.” Republicans are openly debating the validity of birthright citizenship and questioning our commitments to NATO; Democrats now call to “Abolish ICE” or to consciously blow out the national debt as part of a broader, redistributive economic agenda. Court-packing, the breakup of the Big Four tech companies, prison abolition, even the subdivision of states like California—all are now given a public hearing, whereas less than a decade ago they would have gotten one exiled from polite company.\\n\\nFor many thinkers, it’s all cause for both alarm and a cautious hope. “We now have this incredibly draconian anti-immigration policy … despite the fact that it’s driven almost entirely by what are, effectively, extremely fringe ideas,” says Will Wilkinson of the libertarian-leaning think tank the Niskanen Center. “In a way, you’re like, ‘This is awful.’ But from another perspective you can see it as hopeful—that other ideas, if you can find a way to make them part of a successful political program, can be just as effective.”\\n\\nThe leftist political scientist Corey Robin describes the current situation in terms of “regime theory,” an idea borrowed from the world of international relations. He thinks we are in one of those disquieting moments when the big ideological norms of a society suddenly shift, with all the pile-on effects that implies. Trump’s election marked the passing of the bipartisan post-Reagan regime of unfettered free trade and internationalism, necessitating a shuffling of the deck across the political spectrum. As for the character of the next ideas regime, it’s still unclear. “The static rules of politics don’t get suspended,” Robin says. “But the weight of them gets thrown into the air, and called radically into question. Things that were deemed impossible suddenly seem possible.”\\n\\nThat sense of possibility is present up and down this year’s Politico 50 list, from young Stockton, California, Mayor Michael Tubbs’ experiment with universal basic income to Lina Khan’s attempt to drag American antitrust law out of mothballs and modernize it for the Amazon era. Even a so-called establishment Republican like South Carolina Senator Tim Scott is getting into the innovation game, teaming up with the proto-disruptor Sean Parker to get their plan for economic “opportunity zones” in distressed towns into the 2017 tax reform law.\\n\\nIf you’re starting to think that all this mucking about could blow up in the faces of both its creators and its supposed beneficiaries … you’re right. “Disruption” makes a certain sense in the business world, where the consumer tends to benefit from shaking up the established players. In the public sphere, the benefits aren’t so clear. A stable society matters; even some supporters of Trump, political disruptor par excellence, complain about the uncertainty brought on by his constant tweeting and public backtracking.\\n\\nWhat happens after such a chaotic pivot moment? History suggests it could go two ways. The disruptive conservatism of Ronald Reagan settled into a smooth shift away from the old New Deal consensus. But in the preceding century, the frantic, confusion-filled years leading up to the Civil War saw a series of drastic political measures and wrong-headed compromises that ultimately failed to prevent the onset of violent conflict.\\n\\nOf course, that’s a worst-case scenario, and many experts dismiss that prospect for America, which, for all its social-media rancor, is still a wealthy and stable democracy. A moment like this can be unsettling, but it can also be exciting, even inspiring. Reagan’s shakeup infused millions of Americans with a fresh optimism and triggered economic growth. The misery of the Great Depression gave way to an overhauled economic system that protects millions of Americans to this day. A good number of the ideas featured in this issue are the products of clever, principled, resilient Americans, the same kind that led the way forward in past moments of upheaval. The opportunity for them to do so is golden in its own right.\\n\\nDerek Robertson is a news assistant at Politico Magazine.', 'clickbait': array(['1'], dtype='<U1')}\n",

Defying league officials who in the off-season imposed financial penalties for demonstrating during the national anthem, some players during the first weekend of preseason games held up their fists or knelt, a silent protest over police brutality and other forms of institutional racism. President Trump’s willingness to jump back into the fray of the national debate, mockingly questioning whether the players even knew what they were outraged about, signals how divisive the issue remains across the country and across racial lines. This week, just days before the start of the new NFL season, Nike named Colin Kaepernick to its list of iconic athletes for launching the sideline protest, sparking a bitter social media campaign of people destroying their Nike apparel. If nothing else, the persistent furor surrounding the players’ activism demonstrates that when it comes to anthems, one man’s legitimate grievance is another’s grievously unpatriotic insult.\\n\\nPerhaps the most obvious example of this came 50 years ago this autumn, in the politically charged climate of the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City. Violence and repression captured headlines across the globe—from riots in America to clashes in the cities of Eastern Europe. In Mexico City, three winning athletes protested on the medal stand as national anthems played. Most of us know the story of two track stars, Tommie Smith and John Carlos, who were lambasted for holding up black-gloved fists in a black power salute during the playing of the United States’ anthem. But few recall those games’ third protest, one that Americans, indeed much of the world, cheered unreservedly. Our differing reactions to those two moments reveal an uncomfortable truth about us, the viewers, more than anything about the athletes. And they help explain why common ground has proven so difficult to find on the NFL controversy. It turns out many of us love it when an athlete protests during a national anthem, so long as that anthem isn’t our own.\\n\\nStory Continued Below\\n\\nBefore there was Simone Biles, Nadia Comaneci or Mary Lou Retton, Czechoslovak gymnast Vera Caslavska captured the world’s imagination. Winner of 11 Olympic medals (seven gold), Caslavska was the first charismatic, world-famous gymnast. In the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, Caslavska took top honors in the women’s all-around gymnastics competition. In 1967 she became the first female gymnast to earn a perfect 10 in international competition. In 1968, she placed herself squarely at the center of one of the most significant events of the Cold War.\\n\\nStarting in 1948, communist and totalitarian Czechoslovakia acted as a loyal satellite of the Soviet Union. For years the Czechoslovak government had strictly controlled the behavior of its people, prohibiting all dissent in the country and most travel to the West. But during the “Prague Spring” of 1968 the government reversed course to the delight of its citizens. New Communist leader Alexander Dubcek permitted genuine freedom of expression, released the press from government censorship and allowed travel without restriction.\\n\\nCaslavska emerged as one of the most high-profile Czechoslovaks to come out in favor of the reforms, signing onto a widely-distributed manifesto that advocated for even greater freedoms and openness. The Soviets were quick to condemn the document and its signatories, fearing that Czechoslovakia’s break with Soviet orthodoxy might create a brush fire of rebellion among its satellites.\\n\\nEarly in the morning of August 21, 1968, thousands of Soviet tanks and a half a million Warsaw Pact troops rumbled across the Czechoslovakian border, crushing the incipient liberalization experiment. They arrested numerous Czechoslovak political leaders. People who had publicly supported the reforms appeared at risk as well.\\n\\nRightly fearing imprisonment for her advocacy of the reforms, in September Caslavska went into hiding. She trained in isolated secret in a small town in the Czechoslovakian mountains. Missing standard equipment, she reportedly lifted sacks of potatoes to keep up her strength, shoveled coal to build calluses, practiced her floor exercise in a meadow and solidified her other routines by both swinging from and dancing across tree branches.\\n\\nIn October, just days before the start of the games, she gained last-minute approval from the government to head to Mexico City. Her goal was not just to defend her all-around title. In her words, she planned to “sweat blood” to beat the representatives of Czechoslovakia’s invaders. Victory became essential to highlight her country’s plight at the hands of the Soviets.\\n\\nIn the U.S., what we most remember about those Games occurred during the first week of competition. After winning gold and bronze, respectively, in the men’s 200-meter dash, African-American athletes Smith and Carlos each raised a single black glove-covered fist on the medal stand to highlight problems of racial discrimination. Untold numbers of Americans at home reacted with shock and disgust at what they perceived as the athletes’ lack of decorum. Led by American Avery Brundage, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) openly censured the men for bringing politics into the Games and forced the U.S. Olympic Committee to expel Smith and Carlos from Mexico City.\\n\\nThen all eyes turned toward Caslavska, who won her second straight overall women’s gymnastics title. Next, Caslavska dominated the four individual gymnastics events that followed, but twice found herself the victim of controversial judging decisions. A questionable ruling threw the gold medal in the balance beam to a Soviet, leaving Caslavska with the silver. And after Caslavska completed a floor exercise routine that brought down the house, an unusual retroactive upgrade of a Soviet gymnast’s score created a rare tie for first place.\\n\\nIn both cases, already enraged over the Soviets’ invasion of her home, Caslavska lashed out on the medal stand where she created a visual image to project her people’s voice. As the Soviet anthem played, Caslavska turned her head to the right and down, away from the raised Soviet flag. Shown widely on television, Caslavska’s defiance caught the attention of the international press, which made clear the gesture represented her disdain for the repressive regime that occupied her country.\\n\\nCaslavska’s political stands made her more beloved than ever at home, but trouble awaited her there. She refused to withdraw her support for the country’s reformers and even bestowed her gold medals upon them. The new Soviet-backed government purged dissent from Czechoslovak life and banned Caslavska from all official gymnastics activities and foreign travel. At 26-years old, Caslavska was unlikely to compete much longer, but she had expected to become a coach. Instead, now blackballed by the government, she struggled to make a living over the coming years.\\n\\nYet the world has viewed Caslavska and her protest in an overwhelmingly positive light. Caslavska broke out as the clear star of the Games, and one poll reportedly showed her to be the world’s second most popular woman, behind only Jackie Kennedy. In the 1980s, while the Soviet Union still maintained control over her homeland, the IOC awarded Caslavska the “Olympic Order” for her “particularly distinguished contribution to the Olympic Movement.”\\n\\nWhy was the reaction to Caslavska’s defiance so different from what Smith and Carlos faced and the backlash against the NFL protesters today?\\n\\nFirst, it is hard to dismiss the significance of the fact that the Caslavska protest was somewhat subtle and carried out by a small white woman rather than large black men. Like Smith and Carlos, nearly all of the NFL protesters are African-American. Meanwhile, the public perception of the NFL protests diverges sharply along racial lines, with most blacks supporting them and an overwhelming majority of whites opposing such acts.\\n\\nSecond, the targets of the protests were very different. Caslavska’s stand aimed at a specific act committed by a despised, bullying, external Goliath, who was the enemy of much of her audience. In contrast, the American protests turn a mirror inward, toward problems of racial injustice in America. By targeting ills of American society, the protests implicitly indicted America and Americans at the very moment they wanted to feel pride in a national victory.\\n\\nPeople don’t like to feel criticized when they sit down to watch a sporting event, so they push to restrain the expression of such indictments. Indeed, 1968 American critics of Smith and Carlos did not dispute the runners’ message. Rather, they lashed out at the runners’ “conduct,” their act of political expression on the medal stand. Most critics today do not challenge the merits of the issues raised by the NFL protesters. Instead, they attack the protests as unpatriotic and outside what is considered acceptable behavior. (In a little remembered footnote to the 1968 controversy, Peter Norman, the Australian silver medalist in the 200-meter sprint, was rebuked by his countrymen for wearing a badge on his jacket in support of the Americans and their anti-racism message. He was left off the 1972 Olympic team, despite running qualifying times.)\\n\\nStrikingly, such critiques tend to come from those who feel targeted, even if indirectly or symbolically, by the protests. The comparison to the Caslavska protest is telling. Caslavska’s anthem etiquette was similar to that of the American protesters, but her statement was not aimed at us. Her story reminds us that, despite constant claims to the contrary, we do not always decry the entry of politics into sports or even into the playing of a country’s anthem. At times, as long as we do not see ourselves as the target of the protest, we even salute it.\\n\\n\\n\\nEthan Scheiner (@EthanScheiner), a professor of political science at the University of California, Davis, is writing a book about how Czechoslovakia used hockey to fight back against the Soviet Union during the Cold War.', 'clickbait': array(['1'], dtype='<U1')}\n",

We face a confluence of events unique in our 229-year history: A president who is a named subject of a criminal investigation—and on whom the law may be closing in. And a nominee whose previous writings and commentary suggest he believes a sitting president is not subject to investigation or prosecution—views that in effect place the president above the law, although the nominee insists he doesn’t think anyone is beyond its reach.\\n\\nThe confirmation process itself has been rushed and thwarted by the majority, yielding a paltry fraction of the nominee’s White House records needed to evaluate him, with over 100,000 pages withheld based on sweeping and unsubstantiated “constitutional privilege” claims made late on the last business day before the hearing began. Then, over 40,000 of the nominee’s documents were released to the Senate with no real time for review on the evening before the hearing.\\n\\nStory Continued Below\\n\\nAs important as the broken process is this stark fact: Never before has a president made a Supreme Court nomination with so many matters of deep personal importance to that president poised to come before the court. A president facing existential legal jeopardy cannot be permitted to pick his own justice to decide his case—especially a justice whose apparent views of presidential authority are expansive to say the least, who is deeply beholden to that president, and who seems likely to hold the decisive vote. As we explain in a new report out today, applying basic rule-of-law precepts and leading Supreme Court precedents to these unique circumstances identifies a specific range of matters from which the nominee must commit to recuse himself. The hearings must be paused to allow proper production and review of the documentary record followed by full consideration of the relevant facts and controlling law.\\n\\nThe constitutional principles mandating Kavanaugh’s recusal were given form in three recent Supreme Court decisions. The first, Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Company, Inc., concerned recusal obligations of a newly elected West Virginia state supreme court judge in an appeal of an award of damages against the company of a coal baron. The businessman had provided pivotal support to the judge’s campaign while the lawsuit was pending in a lower court. Emphasizing the “significant and disproportionate influence” of the coal baron in placing the judge on the court, the U.S. Supreme Court required recusal based on “serious risk of actual bias” that arises when “a man chooses the judge in his own cause.”\\n\\nSound familiar? It should. It’s eerily similar to the Trump-Kavanaugh nomination, where, to put it mildly, President Donald Trump played a singular role in selecting a judge for a court that likely will have the final word on numerous legal issues in which Trump’s personal stake could not be higher, such as whether a president can be criminally indicted, can be charged with obstructing justice or can pardon himself.\\n\\nA later case went even further. In Williams-Yulee v. Florida Bar, the Supreme Court recognized a separate and independent interest in protecting against the perception of bias in our courts. That case stands for the principle that, beyond the rights of the parties to any individual case, the government and the people it represents have a compelling interest in the impartiality of the court.\\n\\nA third case, Williams v. Pennsylvania, found that a judge’s work before he took the bench could unconstitutionally compromise his later judgment and require recusal. While that case presented a very different factual posture, its concerns apply here.\\n\\nHow can we adequately protect the compelling interest in impartiality without the full record and sufficient time to evaluate it when those proposing the judge’s confirmation persist in hiding vital information about how he might judge the president who named him? Kavanaugh served in high-level White House positions when the Bush administration was pressing to expand executive powers, and records from that period would provide critical information about his potentially decisive views on these matters. The Senate majority has abdicated its oversight responsibilities by rushing the confirmation hearing process before receiving adequate explanation of the president’s document privilege claims—and by refusing even to request White House records from the bulk of Kavanaugh’s time at the White House.\\n\\nThe right thing to do is to pause the hearings so the Senate can discharge those responsibilities. Perhaps a compromise can be reached on the withheld documents, including explaining why the privilege applies to particular documents, as is commonly done when privileges are asserted. Such a hiatus would allow the tens of thousands of documents that have suddenly been dumped on the Senate’s doorstep to be properly studied, the other unprivileged documents produced, and the recusal issues properly addressed.\\n\\nIf the Senate instead pushes forward with the nomination under these circumstances, it will exacerbate the dangers for our democracy already posed by Trump’s attacks on the rule of law and on those charged with neutrally implementing it—and by his efforts to politicize law enforcement, demonize the media, and attack our system of checks and balances. The hundred-year battle for democracy on both sides of the Atlantic teaches that democracy rises and falls in just such accumulations of pivotal moments. Even a potent remedy like the impeachment power has its limits as a weapon in that battle. These lessons must be heeded today.\\n\\nIf, as the media is reporting , Kavanaugh will not commit to recuse from all matters relating to the president’s personal legal exposure, he will be offending the Constitution’s design—as one of us has recently explained —before he ever sets foot on the Supreme Court. Should Congress insist on proceeding nonetheless, the perception of bias will be extreme.\\n\\nIf the Senate and the president elect that course, they should not expect that the American people will forget who made that choice or lessen their resolve to fight for the rule of law they have long enjoyed. Quite the opposite: Forcing the judge through under these circumstances will only redouble the demand for accountability.

Chris Coons put it bluntly when he said President Donald Trump had nominated Kavanaugh with “an eye towards protecting himself.” Mazie Hirono piled on, arguing that Trump’s choice is not surprising given that the president is “committed to self-preservation every minute, every hour, every day.”\\n\\nThese senators are right to be concerned. Kavanaugh seems to hold dangerous views about executive power, views that could undermine special counsel Robert Mueller’s inquiry, ultimately shielding Trump from a criminal investigation. Indeed, Kavanaugh’s writing suggests that, as a justice, he might reject important Supreme Court case law and support the president’s right to refuse to turn over evidence to Mueller’s team. He might also hold that a president can refuse to answer questions in a criminal investigation. In other words, if Kavanaugh is appointed, Trump could have newly found constitutional privileges to undermine Mueller’s investigation.\\n\\nStory Continued Below\\n\\nSenator Richard Blumenthal explained most clearly why the committee needs a deep dive into Kavanaugh’s potentially dangerous views on executive power. He said these hearings are historic because the president is an “unindicted co-conspirator” in the Southern District of New York’s investigation into potentially criminal campaign finance violations involving Trump attorney Michael Cohen. As Blumenthal put it, in the near future, the Supreme Court might face a question of whether to enforce a real system of “checks and balances” or defer to an “imperial presidency” unchecked by the rule of law.\\n\\nIn 1974, the Supreme Court faced the same question. In United States v. Nixon, the court required then President Richard Nixon to hand over tape recordings on which he discussed the break-in at the Watergate. Nixon refused, and his lawyers argued that the nature of his office gave him an “executive privilege” to do so, a right no other person in the United States enjoyed. They argued that the separation of powers and the unique role of the president made him not subject to a criminal subpoena of evidence. But in a unanimous opinion, the Supreme Court rejected that argument and ordered him to hand over the tapes—which turned out to be damning indeed. His resignation from office soon followed. Despite the sensitive nature of the president’s work, the court made clear he was not above the law.\\n\\nDuring his legal career, Kavanaugh has expressed two drastically different views on the U.S. v. Nixon decision and its implications for the scope of executive power. First, Kavanaugh seemed to support it. Working for Ken Starr’s investigation of Bill Clinton, Kavanaugh concluded in a 1995 internal memo that the president could be required to testify while in office. Looking to Kavanaugh’s own writings from that period shows why it’s vital that the president be made accountable. In the memo, Kavanaugh asked rhetorically, “Why should the president be different than anyone else for the purposes of responding to a grand jury subpoena?” At the time he wrote this memo, Kavanaugh seemed to believe that in the American legal system, prosecutors need to find the truth, regardless of how powerful the accused person is.\\n\\nBut this view of a constrained executive branch faded when Kavanaugh worked for President George W. Bush and later as a legal scholar. Far from being a defender of U.S. v. Nixon, during that period Kavanaugh suggested in remarks during a roundtable discussion about executive privilege first reported on by The Associated Press that the case was possibly “wrongly decided” when it held that a president can be subject to a criminal subpoena of information by a special prosecutor. He said, “Nixon took away the power of the president to control information in the executive branch by holding that the courts had power and jurisdiction to order the president to disclose information in response to a subpoena sought by a subordinate executive branch official.”\\n\\nIn other words, a president should not have to answer to employees, including lawyers in the special counsel’s office.\\n\\nA Supreme Court ruling based on this principle could severely hinder Mueller’s investigation of Trump. By rendering unconstitutional any attempt by Mueller to compel Trump to turn over incriminating evidence, such a ruling would make it nearly impossible to amass the information needed for a case against him. If Kavanaugh believes Mueller cannot subpoena evidence from a president, it is also likely that he believes he cannot require him or her to testify, further imperiling the investigation. This effective immunity from criminal investigation is exactly what defenders of a limited presidency should be worried about.\\n\\nIf Kavanaugh really does hold this view of expansive executive power, the Senate should reject his nomination to the Supreme Court—an institution whose job it is to enforce the law impartially and keep the other branches of government in check. Holding the president accountable for wrongdoing has always been an essential constitutional principle. But it is especially salient today, with our current president facing multiple accusations of crimes and abuses of the office. Granting Trump immunity would convey to the American people that elected officials can abuse the public’s trust without consequences.\\n\\nThe presidency is a unique job, and there’s a pragmatic case for presidents keeping some sensitive information private. Yet when the Framers wrote the Constitution, setting up our system of laws, they made no special exceptions for the chief executive. As George Mason asked about the president at the Constitutional Convention, “Shall any man be above justice? Above all shall that man be above it, who can commit the most extensive injustice?”\\n\\nIn fact, the oath of office places special requirements on the president to serve the public and uphold the law. A president who wants to “preserve, protect and defend” constitutional principles must be willing to subject him or herself to investigation—just like all the other citizens he or she serves.\\n\\nWhen the president won’t do that willingly, the nation needs the judicial branch to step in as a check, just as the Framers intended. If Kavanaugh won’t help the judicial branch play that role, he should not have a seat on the court.\\n\\nThe United States is at a historic moment. We have a president who is potentially guilty of a criminal act. His oath of office requires him to respect the rule of law and to defend the Constitution. Instead, he seems more interested in using the office and its potentially vast powers to escape accountability. We cannot allow a new justice to take his oath of judicial office as a means of helping the president to disregard his own oath of presidential office.\\n\\nCorey Brettschneider is professor of political science at Brown University and visiting professor at Fordham Law School.

New Yorker staff writer Kathryn Schulz pronounced herself “beyond appalled” at the invitation. Roxane Gay, Jessica Valenti and others concurred.\\n\\nThe spreading outrage left Remnick straddled on the horns of a dilemma: Interview Bannon and watch the festival collapse under the weight of a boycott, or back down and save the show. In an email to his staff, Remnick sounded all the right notes as he explained the rationale behind his planned one-on-one grilling of Bannon on the New Yorker stage. “The point of an interview, a rigorous interview, particularly in a case like this, is to put pressure on the views of the person being questioned,” he wrote. But in the final paragraph of his memo, Remnick tucked tail and conceded that the “concerns” of readers, staffers, and colleagues had caused him to change his mind. A New Yorker forum might not be the best way to interrogate Bannon, Remnick wrote, so he was uninviting him but would attempt to interview him for the magazine in the future.\\n\\n“Gutless,” responded Bannon.\\n\\nThe primary objection to the invitation coalesced around the idea that the New Yorker should never present a bigot or a fascist or a xenophobe like Bannon to such a distinguished audience, thereby normalizing hate. Exactly how a hardball Remnick interview with Bannon would normalize anything has yet to be explained. How many New Yorker readers—you know who you are—attending the festival were likely to start thinking of Bannon as “normal” after Remnick cross-examined him? Too few to count, I reckon. So the Bannon ban wasn’t designed to protect New Yorker fans.\\n\\nThen for whose benefit was the no-platforming of Bannon? The people who weren’t going to attend but might hear of it and began to think Bannon’s abhorrent ideas were OK because a New Yorker event hosted him? I doubt that very many of those people exist, either.\\n\\nSome no-platformers say Bannon should be starved of future publicity because, in addition to his ideas being hateful and the fact that he no longer wields White House power, he’s overexposed already! As Media Matters recently put it, Bannon has said everything he has to say at least almost two-dozen times over the past six months in interviews with GQ, the New York Times, Reuters, the Washington Post, the BBC, CNN, the National Interest, The Daily Beast, New York, Politico and others. If persistent repetition is a good reason to cut Bannon’s mic, then I’d love to see the same logic applied to Media Matters, which operates a very loud echo chamber of its own.\\n\\nObviously, Bannon has no “right” to a New Yorker invitation, as the no-platformers like to say. And as Remnick noted, he would have been paid an honorarium and travel and lodging expenses, an idea many found repulsive. But organizers like Remnick have every right to stage whatever ideas and speakers they want without interference. If you value free expression the way I do, you recognize Remnick and the New Yorker Festival and not Steve Bannon as the injured parties here. As long as we’re counting the injured, let’s include the curious folks who wanted to buy a ticket to the Remnick-Bannon match but were denied.\\n\\nIs Bannonism so contagious and corrosive that it must be suppressed? If you really fear Bannon’s thoughts, isn’t it better to allow a mind like Remnick’s to dissect and refute them rather than trying to no-platform them into oblivion? Talking to a monster is not necessarily an endorsement of a monster’s ideas. The whole episode is enough to make you wonder whether the celebrities who bailed from the festival even read the magazine, which routinely steers its way into conflict and controversy. As New Yorker writer Malcolm Gladwell put it in a tweet, “I would have thought that the point of a festival of ideas was to expose the audience to ideas. If you only invite your friends over, it’s called a dinner party.”\\n\\nThe urge to drop a cordon sanitaire around Bannon comes from the same paternal impulse that causes censors to ban political ideas, books, art, vulgarity, music, religion, dance and erotica they don’t like. By playing the guardian, Bannon’s foes think they’re protecting the masses. Instead, they’ve allowed him to play the martyr — and only made him stronger.\\n\\n******\\n\\nDisclosure: I was a New Yorker Festival panelist in 2008. From the looks of the New Yorker Festival schedule, the Bannon interview would have been the most journalistic of all the sessions. What or whom would you like to censor?

America was mired in a recession—still-new President Ronald Reagan was being forced to defend to a skeptical public his economic policies—while members of Congress fretted about the chances of a nuclear war with the Soviet Union. Despite this uncertainty, a few conservative students at elite law schools sensed not anxiety but a moment of opportunity. Inspired by Reagan’s ideology and emboldened by his election, they did something ambitious to the point of audacious. They asked a collection of the country’s most notable right-leaning scholars, judges and Department of Justice officials to assemble at one of the very hubs of liberal orthodoxy, the campus of Yale University. Convened principally by Steven Calabresi, who was at Yale Law, and Lee Liberman and David McIntosh, who were at University of Chicago Law, some 200 people arrived in New Haven, Connecticut, on the last weekend of April for a three-day symposium.\\n\\nIt had a dry title—“A Symposium on Federalism: Legal and Political Ramifications”—and it easily could have been just another set of lectures, of interest only to a small lot of participants and attendees, the kind of higher-ed, corkboard-flyer get-togethers that happen all the time with no broader fanfare or larger lasting consequences. But at this one, as speakers castigated what they viewed as coastal elites and a leftist media and legal establishment and argued for a more “originalist” reading of the Constitution, people present felt a new sort of buzz. In the hallways, between the sessions, the vibe was more than just brainy. It was practically giddy.\\n\\nStory Continued Below\\n\\n“I sense,” Ted Olson, then an assistant attorney general in the DOJ’s Office of Legal Counsel, declared in his talk that weekend, “that we are at one of those points in history where the pendulum may be beginning to swing in another direction.” It would prove to be one of the most prescient things anybody said at the entire symposium.\\n\\nWhen I recently read to him over the telephone this part of a transcript of his speech, Olson got audibly excited. “I’m proud of myself,” he said. “The feeling was in the air,” he told me, “that things could happen.”\\n\\nHere, in fact, is what happened: the birth of the Federalist Society. In the 36 years since, it has become one of the most influential legal organizations in history—not only shaping law students’ thinking but changing American society itself by deliberately, diligently shifting the country’s judiciary to the right. Its members filtered into presidential administrations and federal courts. Robert Bork, one of the featured speakers at that first symposium, was nominated to the Supreme Court, and, although he wasn’t confirmed, another big-name speaker from that weekend later was: Antonin Scalia, who would anchor the Supreme Court’s conservative wing. Today, a remarkable four of nine of the country’s top justices have Federalist Society ties, and the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh—literally picked from a list given to President Donald Trump by the organization’s executive vice president—would make five.\\n\\nOver the years, the Federalists have honed a disciplined, excessively modest narrative of their origins and purpose—that they are simply a facilitator of the exchange of ideas, a high-minded fulcrum of right-of-center thought, a debating society that doesn’t take overtly partisan, political positions. That narrative is not wrong. It’s just not the whole truth. The full story of that initial weekend—based on interviews with people who were there, as well as the seldom-read words of the speeches recorded in a 1982 issue of the conservative Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy—reveals something different. The effort was, from the get-go, aggressively political. There was a feeling of steeling for a fight.\\n\\n“I think they did see it as a long-term battle,” says Amanda Hollis-Brusky, a Pomona College political scientist and author of Ideas with Consequences, a book about the Federalist Society.\\n\\nThe symposium program (“Federalism from the Standpoint of the Department of Justice,” “Some Thoughts on Applied Federalism,” “Federalism—Why Should We Care?”) could have been seen as mind-numbingly narrow and academic, but the thrust of the topics of discussion that weekend prefigured with startling accuracy the national legal and cultural battles to come.\\n\\nBork, for example, who had been a law professor at Yale and had just become a federal judge, spoke of “the onslaught of the New Deal” and “the gentrification of the Constitution.” Abortion and “acceptable sexual behavior,” he said, should be “reserved to the states.” Pointedly, with Roe v. Wade, he said, the Supreme Court had “nationalized an issue which is a classical case for local control. There is simply no national moral consensus about abortion, and there is not about to be.”\\n\\n“Keep in mind,” advised Scalia, then a law professor at the University of Chicago four months from his first judgeship, “that the federal government is not bad but good. The trick is to use it wisely.”\\n\\nThe effort was, from the get-go, aggressively political. There was a feeling of steeling for a fight.\\n\\nPerhaps even more important than the content of the speeches was what happened in the less scheduled moments. Outside the lecture hall, over lunch and dinner and drinks, people who knew one another’s work and ideology in many instances met for the first time. Scalia and Bork took smoke breaks, kibitzing with eager, genuflecting students. “The fact that the students wanted to talk to you, and wanted to hear your views, I thought, ‘Boy, this is terribly refreshing,’” Olson told me. “And to have these kinds of conversations, it was almost as if there were people that were hungry that just needed to be fed.” Morton Blackwell, president of the Leadership Institute and a longtime organizer of young conservatives, recalled the sensation of sparks flying. “Nice sparks,” he said in an interview. “Bright sparks.” They continued into the evenings. “There were parties that went into the night,” said Grover Joseph Rees III, another one of the speakers. Students with sleeping bags crammed into dorm rooms. So, too, even, did some of the presenters. “I remember,” said Michael McConnell, then the 27-year-old assistant general counsel to the Office of Management and Budget and now a law professor at Stanford. “I slept on somebody’s floor that I didn’t even know.”\\n\\nIt is no exaggeration to suggest that it was perhaps the most effective student conference ever—a blueprint, in retrospect, for how to marry youthful enthusiasm with intellectual oomph to achieve far-reaching results.\\n\\nWhen I talked with Rees, he likened the founding weekend of the Federalist Society to Woodstock. “I went to Woodstock,” said Rees, who was a law professor at the University of Texas when he went to the symposium and would go on to become a judge and ambassador. “And all I knew was I was going to a rock festival. I didn’t know it was going to be Woodstock.”\\n\\n\\n\\n***\\n\\nThe seeds of the symposium and, ultimately, the Federalist Society as a whole had been planted at least two years earlier. In the fall of 1980, Calabresi would recall in an interview with the ABA Journal, he was struck by what happened when the 88 members of his first-year class at Yale Law were asked whether they had voted for Reagan: Only two people raised their hands. Either the student body was really that ideologically imbalanced, or many were reluctant to be open about their conservative preferences. It was almost immaterial. “We needed an organization to at least encourage others to come forward,” Calabresi said. In Chicago, along with McIntosh, Liberman thought the same thing. “There was no student organization that seemed interested in Reagan’s legal ideas,” she said later in an interview with a University of North Carolina doctoral student, Jonathan Riehl, who wrote his dissertation about the Federalist Society, “and this seemed a little odd, given that he had just won the presidency.”\\n\\nIt had been this way for decades. “The law schools were exceedingly one-sided,” McConnell, the Stanford law professor, told me. Being a conservative then at a college or a law school, Scalia later said to biographer Joan Biskupic, made one feel “isolated, lonely … like a weirdo.” Spencer Abraham, the former senator from Michigan, started the Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy when he was a student at Harvard Law in the late 1970s, and he described the publication in its first volume as vox clamantis in deserto, Latin for “a voice crying in the wilderness.”\\n\\nYale University, April 1982 Among the speakers at the first Federalist Society meeting were Robert Bork, then a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit; Antonin Scalia, then a law professor at the University of Chicago; and Ted Olson, then a DOJ assistant attorney general.\\n\\nCredit: AP; Getty Images\\n\\nIn this tilted environment, Liberman, McIntosh and Calabresi saw themselves as “sort of a resistance movement,” according to Danielle McLaughlin, who co-authored, along with Michael Avery, The Federalist Society: How Conservatives Took the Law Back from Liberals. The three of them had been friends as undergraduates at Yale. All of them were active in the formative Yale Political Union, with Calabresi and McIntosh serving in consecutive years as president of the organization. Liberman had volunteered for Reagan in his campaigns in 1976 and 1980, and McIntosh had joined the effort in 1980. They had interned for senators in the summers. And now, said Hollis-Brusky, they began thinking about ways to “to build up a legal counter-elite.”\\n\\n“Part of Reagan’s policy was to build up forces in battleground nations in order to help topple enemy regimes,” Calabresi told Riehl, “and I thought of us as kind of the same equivalent in law schools.”\\n\\nAt Yale, Calabresi and a couple of conservative law students formed a student group in the fall of 1981. Eating lunch one day, according to a subsequent telling in the journal at Harvard, they batted about possible names. The Ludwig von Mises Society? The Alexander Bickel Society? The Anti-Federalist Society? The Anti-Federalists, after all, were the ones who sought a more decentralized government at the time of the founding of the country. They landed, though, on the Federalist Society, because it invoked the Federalist Papers and the long-running American debate about the appropriate balance of power between the national and state governments. Calabresi and the nascent organization recruited as advisers Bork, who had been a solicitor general and (briefly) acting attorney general under Richard Nixon, and Ralph Winter, another conservative bigwig at Yale Law who also was one of Reagan’s early judicial appointees.\\n\\nIn Chicago, Liberman and McIntosh, who talked frequently by phone with Calabresi at Yale, started a similar student group. Their faculty adviser? Scalia. At their first meeting, according to Biskupic’s biography, he read a passage from Federalist No. 49 about the power of ideas being contingent on a breadth of belief: “The reason of man, like man himself, is timid and cautious when left alone, and acquits firmness and confidence in proportion to the number with which it is associated.” In essence: “Intellectual courage,” Scalia said, is based on strength in numbers.\\n\\nSo the two groups started by three friends with the backing of star professors endeavored to expand those numbers. “They had chutzpah,” Olson told me. Connections, too. They started to plan for a first symposium by sending out invitations.\\n\\n“It certainly sounded inviting enough,” recalled Lino Graglia, a law professor at the University of Texas who had written a book about the ills of affirmative action and agreed to speak at the symposium. “They said they were getting together a bunch of well-known figures.” Beyond that, he said, in contrast to the prevailing liberal slant at law schools, this “was going to introduce a conservative view—and, well, that had a lot of appeal.”\\n\\n“We wanted to be able to talk about ideas, share ideas,” McConnell said.\\n\\nIt was, remembered Charles Fried, a law professor at Harvard who would be the solicitor general in Reagan’s second term, “an intriguing invitation—the very name.”\\n\\n“I think this will be a lot of fun,” Liberman wrote to Bork, “particularly watching the reaction of Yale, which will think it has created a Frankenstein monster.”\\n\\nThey had the beginnings of buy-in. Now they needed arguably an even more important lubricant. Money. Leveraging a recommendation from Scalia, Calabresi contacted the conservative Institute for Educational Affairs to ask. “As Professor Scalia of the University of Chicago Law School mentioned to you last Wednesday on the telephone, we are interested in holding a symposium,” he wrote early that February in a letter archived among Bork’s papers at the Library of Congress. “Professor Scalia said you thought I.E.A. might be quite interested in sponsoring and funding such a symposium.” Calabresi estimated that it would cost “in the neighborhood of $24,000.” It ended up being closer to $25,000. And it worked. IEA wrote a check that covered most of the cost. The rest came from donors, including the John M. Olin Foundation and the Intercollegiate Studies Institute.\\n\\nA week and a half later, Liberman sent a letter to Bork. Her excitement was palpable on the page—as was her ambition. She evidently had been angling for his help to get Supreme Court Justice William Rehnquist to consider speaking at the symposium. “I have no idea if this would matter to him at all,” Liberman wrote, “but if it would, we could probably come up with some sort of award to present to him at the Saturday banquet.” She ended her letter with a note about what this new, expanding outfit would be called: “Finally, our group out here settled on Federalist Society as a name, which I suppose makes up in euphony what it lacks in accuracy. If you have any brilliant ideas for a better name, however, that would be splendid.” Liberman thanked Bork again for his assistance and support. “I think this will be a lot of fun,” she concluded, “particularly watching the reaction of Yale, which will think it has created a Frankenstein monster.”\\n\\nWith that, Liberman enclosed for Bork their finished proposal for the symposium. “Law schools and the legal profession are currently strongly dominated by a form of orthodox liberal ideology which advocates a centralized and uniform society,” the statement of purpose said. “While some members of the legal community have dissented from these views, no comprehensive conservative critique or agenda has been formulated in this field. This conference will furnish an occasion for such a response to begin to be articulated.”\\n\\nA one-paragraph, 103-word brief about the upcoming conference ran in National Review. “Anyone interested (most especially including law students) should write The Federalist Society,” it said, giving an address in New Haven.\\n\\nWhat started to arrive from law students on dozens of other campuses were not only notes expressing interest in attending. The symposium hadn’t even taken place, but they wanted to know how to start chapters of their own.\\n\\n\\n\\n***\\n\\nUsing Room 127, Yale Law’s largest classroom, but not the more spacious auditorium, “which the administration has commandeered,” Liberman had written to Bork, the venue made the group feel bigger than it actually was. It was in this sense a fitting setting, helping to concentrate the energy of a very rarefied call to arms.\\n\\n“It is an intellectual debate,” Bork said in his talk.\\n\\nAnd at that point, it was one they were losing. “Conservatives have simply been outgunned at the federal level for half a century,” Scalia said.\\n\\n“When liberals are in power,” he added, “they do not shrink from using the federal structure of what they consider to be sound governmental goals.”\\n\\nThe solution, according to Blackwell, the veteran organizer of young conservatives? “Study how to win,” he told the symposium audience.\\n\\nIn his presentation that weekend, Blackwell pointed to his own political training as a foot soldier for landslide presidential loser Barry Goldwater in 1964. “Conservatives,” he told those gathered, “had the belief that being right, in the sense of being correct, was sufficient to prevail—that victory would naturally fall into our deserving hands like a ripe fruit off of a tree. We believed in the Sir Galahad theory: ‘I shall win because my heart is pure.’ But that is not the way the real world works.”\\n\\nHe made his point plain. The path to victory ran through the law. Through the judiciary.\\n\\nThe Supreme Court Today Four of the eight sitting Supreme Court justices—Clarence Thomas, John Roberts, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch—as well as nominee Brett Kavanaugh, have Federalist Society ties, now a de facto prerequisite for conservative judges hoping to join the highest court.\\n\\nCredit: Getty Images\\n\\nHe ticked off a to-do list: “How to get the right people into the study of law. How to get into the right law school. How to succeed as a conservative in law school. Law student participation in politics and government. How to get better people on law faculties. How to get a good clerking job. How to become a judge. How to make sure the right people get to be judges.”\\n\\nIt energized the people who attended the Federalist Society’s first symposium—Winter called it “the most extraordinary gathering” he had seen in his almost 20 years at Yale—and when they left on the afternoon of Sunday, April 25, 1982, they could see the future.\\n\\n“The fact that all these people were getting together seemed to inspire people not to just walk away from that saying, ‘That was a great experience’—but to walk away from it thinking, ‘We need to keep doing things like this. We need to have more of these. We need to do this on different campuses. We need to come together and see what happens,’” Olson told me. There was, he said, “intellectual fire burning.”\\n\\n“I was gratified,” added Blackwell. “I was optimistic.”\\n\\nIt was justified. The event had elicited coverage from the Associated Press and the New York Times—both outlets focused primarily on Bork’s comments—and the organizers hastened to send out thank you notes. “Your participation,” Liberman and Calabresi wrote to Bork, “was without doubt crucial to its being such a successful weekend.” They were clear, too, about the scope of their intentions.\\n\\nFive months after the heady weekend at Yale, it was official: The Federalist Society, technically the Federalist Society for Law & Public Policy Studies, was a national, nonprofit corporation. Charles Bork, Robert Bork’s son, drew its logo, a silhouette of James Madison—“supposedly giving Madison a ‘nose job,’ since Madison’s actual profile was deemed ‘too ugly to be on any brochure,’” according to the journal at Harvard.\\n\\nIn the following five years, the society established an office in Washington and watched chapters open at 15 law schools, then 30, then 75, then more. It opened membership not just to students but also to practicing lawyers. It placed ads in National Review and had more annual symposia, hopscotching from one elite institution to the next. The following year, it was at Chicago. Then it was at Harvard, then Georgetown, then Stanford. The crowds grew.\\n\\nSo did the coffers. One factor that helped to make the Federalist Society something far more than simply an important student uprising was a thrilled collection of right-wing donors who had been waiting for precisely this sort of organization. Backed by the IEA, the Scaife Foundation, the Olin Foundation, the Bradley Foundation and the Deer Creek Foundation, to go with membership dues, the society’s budget vaulted past $1 million.\\n\\nCritically, too, more and more members began showing up to work in Washington, the start in earnest of these insiders who felt like outsiders becoming insiders with actual power. Barely more than a couple of years after their beliefs were a source of ostracism on their campuses, they now wielded adherence to Federalist Society principles as a qualifying credential. Shot-callers in the Reagan administration saw it as a sort of stamp of approval. As counselor to the president, Edwin Meese stocked the administration with young Federalists—including Calabresi, Liberman and McIntosh, all of whom worked as assistant attorneys general. They were ready, as Steven M. Teles phrased it in his book The Rise of the Conservative Legal Movement, for “bureaucratic hand-to-hand combat.”\\n\\nOlson, well on his way to being President George W. Bush’s solicitor general, one of Time’s 100 most influential people and an attorney who has argued more than 60 cases before the Supreme Court, welcomed the lot of them by having cookouts at his house in northern Virginia, taking a page from the first symposium and mixing students and interns with prominent judges, clerks, attorneys and public officials—the energy of that weekend in New Haven refracting in new ways and growing exponentially. “Over the years,” he said, “I’ve gone all sorts of places, and people come up to me and say, ‘I was in your backyard … ’”\\n\\n“We thought we had planted a wildflower in the weeds of academic liberalism,” Scalia said. “Instead it was an oak.”\\n\\nThe society’s run of success was not uninterrupted. In 1987, Bork’s Supreme Court nomination was scuttled by a liberal-led Senate campaign that used Bork’s own words on issues such as Roe v. Wade—issues he had spoken about at the symposium. It angered and motivated members of the Federalist Society, convincing them they needed to redouble their efforts. “It was a galvanizing defeat,” Hollis-Brusky told me, demonstrating to some of them that they had tried to come too far, too fast. It also reinforced the notion that ideological purity wasn’t the only ingredient to transforming the judiciary. Raw politics mattered as well. And nearly two decades later, the Federalists would cement their power by keeping someone off the court. In 2005, they agitated for the withdrawal of George W. Bush’s nominee Harriet Miers, who had no Federalist Society ties (and a conspicuously scant résumé), leading to the nomination of Samuel Alito, who did. The episode affirmed the way in which the society’s influence had grown. Alito joined fellow Federalist Society contributors Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Chief Justice John Roberts.\\n\\nGoing on a quarter-century after its initial symposium, the organization had markedly and undeniably changed the nature of the judiciary. It earned begrudging plaudits for its effectiveness from unlikely sources. “They deliberately set out to do so,” Hillary Clinton, then the junior senator from New York, told Riehl, the UNC doctoral student, in 2006. “I think you have to respect that.”\\n\\n“Beyond our wildest dreams,” Calabresi said in 2007 at the society’s 25th-anniversary gala.\\n\\n“We thought we had planted a wildflower in the weeds of academic liberalism,” Scalia told the crowd of 1,800 members at Washington’s Union Station. “Instead it was an oak.”\\n\\n\\n\\n***\\n\\nBy 2016, the sheer power of the Federalist Society was undeniable. Ironically, though, it was all the more brightly defined by the demise of one of its biggest and earliest boosters. The death of Scalia on February 13, 2016, put control of the Supreme Court squarely in the balance of the presidential election. Every candidate, both Republican and Democratic, understood that immediately—but Trump was the one who best used it to his advantage. He needed to. Nobody in the GOP field had to curry conservative favor more than Trump, a longtime registered Democrat with a record of supporting abortion rights. And he went to work at that.\\n\\n“The totally unexpected loss of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia is a massive setback for the Conservative movement and our COUNTRY!” he tweeted the day Scalia died.\\n\\nFour days later, during a rally in Walterboro, South Carolina, Trump was customarily unsubtle. “We lost a great Supreme Court justice,” he said, “and nobody thought this was going to be part of the equation, and all of a sudden, if somebody gets in the wrong person … ”\\n\\nBut the people who knew the “right” people? The Federalist Society. In the spring of that year, as Trump zeroed in on the Republican nomination at the expense of society stalwart Ted Cruz, he had his attorney Don McGahn call executive vice president Leonard Leo to set up a meeting at Trump Tower. They would end up meeting in March at the Washington law offices of Jones Day. It turned out that Trump wanted Leo to make a list of the sort of judges he would pick to put on the Supreme Court if he were elected president. He wanted, in essence, to subcontract this task to the Federalist Society, which had performed this duty for previous Republican presidents but never so explicitly—a presidential candidate campaigning loudly against intellectual elites turning unabashedly to a group hatched in that exact environment.\\n\\nIn May, with Leo’s advice, Trump made public a list of 11 judges. In September, the list grew to 21. No presidential candidate had ever done this. “I thought it was a brilliant stroke,” Leo would tellNational Review. Trump spent the rest of the campaign making sure everybody knew. “All picked by the Federalist Society,” he said in June. “The gold standard,” he said in July.\\n\\nFor a would-be president who needed to assuage concern about his conservative credentials, this is what did it. And he has delivered, with the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch and now the nomination of Kavanaugh.\\n\\nIt is a strange yet somehow oddly perfect match—Trump, impetuous and transactional, and the Federalist Society, intellectual and methodical.\\n\\nLooking back on that weekend in New Haven, and considering what the group has become, the people who were there talk with some mixture of surprise, satisfaction and awe at where this led—literally handing a potential president, a New York playboy and showboat, a onetime casino tycoon, a roster of acceptable judges.\\n\\n“Spectacular,” Blackwell said of the growth and influence of the Federalist Society.\\n\\n“Isn’t it?” Fried added with a laugh.\\n\\n“I remember Leonard Leo when he was just this little kid out of Cornell Law School,” Graglia told me. “Nice little kid, nice little guy—I didn’t expect he’d become America’s judge-picker.”\\n\\nNo one did. Who could have? In early 1982, after all, as Calabresi, Liberman and McIntosh were consulting with Scalia, Winter and Bork about “A Symposium on Federalism: Legal and Political Ramifications,” Trump was obtaining approvals in New Jersey for his first casino in Atlantic City, talking about buying the New York Daily News and working toward the completion of the construction of Trump Tower—its “topping-off” ceremony that summer drawing Mayor Ed Koch and Governor Hugh Carey, Democrats who called the structure on Fifth Avenue “first-rate” and lauded donor-developer Trump for his “ingenuity and determination.” Today, Calabresi is a law professor at Northwestern. Liberman (now Liberman Otis) is a senior vice president for the Federalist Society. McIntosh is the president of the Club for Growth. And Trump is president of the United States. He already has put one justice on the Supreme Court, and he is about to make it two—it could end up being four. That would make seven Supreme Court justices with Federalist Society ties.\\n\\nIt is a strange yet somehow oddly perfect match—Trump, impetuous and transactional, and the Federalist Society, intellectual and methodical. Trump is president for a long list of reasons, of course, but near the top of that list is the imprimatur the Federalist Society granted him. He almost certainly couldn’t have gotten what he wanted without the Federalists. And they almost certainly couldn’t have gotten what they wanted without him. It’s an open question whether conservative voices have achieved their yearned-for parity on law school campuses. Trump doesn’t appear to share the Federalists’ beliefs about small government or states’ rights or academic rigor, and his time as president will end, at some point, one way or another. But his influence unquestionably will outlast his tenure. It will go on for decades. On the scorecard that matters maybe most of all—who sits in the most important seats in the nation’s most important courts—the architects of the Federalist Society have attained a level of influence on the courts they never could have imagined, in a way they never could have envisioned. Trump is changing the country. He has already changed it, because of them.\\n\\nMichael Kruse is a senior staff writer for Politico Magazine.', 'clickbait': array(['1'], dtype='<U1')}\n",

Daley turned his town into a fortress. He sealed the manhole covers with tar, so protesters couldn’t hide in the sewers. He installed a fence topped with barbed wire around the Chicago International Amphitheater. He put the entire police force of 12,000 men on 12-hour shifts and called in over 5,000 National Guardsmen. About 1,000 Secret Service and FBI agents were also on duty, as the city braced for the 10,000 protesters who would soon arrive, wound up by a year of political assassinations, urban riots and the raging Vietnam War.\\n\\nWhat could possibly go wrong?\\n\\nStory Continued Below\\n\\nWith the whole world watching, the three major news networks brought the answer to that question into millions of Americans’ living rooms. They spared barely a second of the ensuing mayhem in their coverage—and in the course of doing so sparked a national debate about objectivity and journalistic integrity. The liberal-minded tuned in and saw textbook police brutality and “Gestapo tactics,” in the words of Connecticut Senator Abraham Ribicoff. But millions of Middle Americans, the citizens Richard M. Nixon would later immortalize as the “silent majority,” saw an entirely different display of excess—on the part not of the police, but of the TV networks.\\n\\nThe Archie Bunkers of America, impassive to the hippies’ and yippies’ plight, saw them playing the newsmen like a fiddle, getting free publicity for their cause and, ultimately, getting what they deserved from the police. The protesters hurled profanities at the cops. They engaged in street theater, nominating a pig as the Democratic presidential candidate. They attempted to sleep in the parks (defying the 11 p.m. curfew) and to hold marches even though permits had been denied by the city. Allen Ginsberg even led the kids in chanting “Om.” The “establishment” response was swift and violent. As right-wing pundit Robert Novak later observed, “The demonstrators came looking for trouble and got what they wanted.” Viewed from that perspective, the 1968 Democratic convention was an inflection point for conservatives who would protest that the mainstream media was, in words that now echo from the White House, “the enemy of the people.”\\n\\nThe violence in Chicago was all-encompassing, and longhairs weren’t the only targets of what the federal government’s Walker Report later described as a “police riot” in the streets outside the convention. Delegates from the convention themselves—accountants in Brooks Brothers shirts, librarians with prim leatherette handbags—who wandered onto Michigan Avenue found themselves flying ass-over-tea-kettle through plate glass windows. Journalists with clearly displayed credentials were attacked, including, most notoriously, CBS’ Dan Rather.\\n\\nToday, it’s taken for granted that much of our news coverage is slanted left or right, but in the network era there was still a deeply held belief that news could (and should) be completely neutral. The tumult of the 1960s tore apart that notion, even as many viewers struggled to hang onto it. We tend to think of the pre-Watergate era as an Edenic vista of trust and fidelity toward our institutions, especially the media—but the skepticism and stubborn partisan distrust that many feel today was present then, too. The real-time controversy and spin surrounding the shocking images that came from Chicago, many of them revisited here for the first time since August 1968, laid the foundation for the cries of “liberal bias” that hound and undermine the mainstream news media to this day.\\n\\n\\n\\n***\\n\\nWith all due respect to NBC’s Chet Huntley and David Brinkley, CBS’ Walter Cronkite was the pre-eminent emcee of the whole affair. Cronkite’s obvious animus toward right-wingers Robert Taft in 1948 and Barry Goldwater in 1964 had caused some political friction, but he was generally seen by most TV viewers as a moderate, establishment type of guy. He was perplexed by hippies, including his own daughters, with their “indescribable” outfits that looked like they came from a “remnant sale.” He recognized that the young generation no doubt saw him as “an old fuddy-duddy.”\\n\\nIt was this very middle-of-the-road squareness that had made his 1968 Report from Vietnam so impactful. The networks had dutifully reported JFK’s and LBJ’s pronouncements on imminent victory in Vietnam for some time, and Cronkite himself had been suckered as well by the carefully managed news conferences and briefings he had attended in Saigon in 1965. At that point, he was, as biographer Douglas Brinkley put it, “a cautious hawk.” When the Tet Offensive erupted in early 1968, Cronkite returned to Vietnam for a less varnished picture, and upon his return he reluctantly reported that America was facing a stalemate in Southeast Asia, at best. President Lyndon B. Johnson was agog, proclaiming (perhaps apocryphally) that “If I’ve lost Cronkite, I’ve lost Middle America.”\\n\\nHeading into Chicago, then, Cronkite had already pointed out the elephant in the room with regard to Vietnam. This may have been controversial to hawks, but CBS wasn’t deluged with angry viewer mail. To the majority of viewers, Cronkite’s Vietnam broadcast was more of a wake-up call than a partisan assault. “Uncle Walter” was regularly rated in surveys as the most trusted man in America.\\n\\nBut Chicago was different. Not just because Cronkite was sympathetic to the youngsters in the streets, but because he lost his cool. After his correspondent, Dan Rather, was punched in the solar plexus by a Chicago plainclothes security man on the delegate floor, Cronkite let loose, saying, “I think we’ve got a bunch of thugs here, Dan.” Asked once why Cronkite was so trusted, his wife had responded, “he looks like everyone’s dentist.” But in calling out Daley’s thugs, he had given his conservative viewers a surprise root canal.\\n\\nCronkite thanked Rather “for staying in there, pitching despite every handicap that they can possibly put in our way from free flow of information at this Democratic National Convention.” The atmosphere of control sometimes manifested itself in crudely obvious ways: Every day that the convention started late or was delayed by unruly delegates who happened to disappear when a vote was needed, the house band would fill up time with excruciatingly upbeat show tunes. They even took cues from Daley, who would signal whether voices or songs of protest from delegates needed drowning out.\\n\\nCronkite clearly suspected that Daley had purposely avoided resolving the electrical workers’ strike in order to hinder network coverage. When resolution of the strike was announced just an hour after Humphrey’s Vietnam plank was confirmed (which, by extension, confirmed his pending nomination), Cronkite announced on-air that it was “one of those amazing, almost unbelievable coincidences that have marked this whole convention in the restrictions on the press. ... little things here and there that just so amazingly seem to come together to force the press into a mold that the convention managers wanted us to fit into here.”\\n\\nThe formal union vote would take place in just a few days, which would end not only the strike but also “the total news blackout”—an exaggeration illustrating the anchorman’s extreme frustration. But, “of course, it won’t matter then,” he added, because the networks would be long gone.\\n\\nThe snark might have seemed like unfair editorializing to some viewers, but Cronkite simply understood how Daley operated. The consummate professional, Cronkite also tried to express his frustration in a more neutral, even folksy way: “Dick Daley’s a fine fellow, but when his strong hand is turned agin’ you, as the press has felt it was on this occasion, he’s a tough adversary.”\\n\\nIt pained Cronkite in particular that he could not show breaking news live as it unfurled. When CBS cut away from the amphitheater to footage of police violence, Cronkite carefully noted over and over again that it was recorded, not live, because of the electrical workers’ strike. The videotapes—and some hastily developed 16mm film—had to be transported 50 blocks by car or motorcycle. And the mayor didn’t even allow that the networks might break the speed limit.\\n\\n\\n\\n***\\n\\nDaley prepared for the convention like a general going into battle. When rioting had erupted in Chicago four months earlier following The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination, the police had been unable to seize control. Venting his disappointment, Daley had said that his police superintendent should have ordered his force to “shoot to maim” looters and “shoot to kill” arsonists. He vowed not to be caught short again.\\n\\nThe mayor was a masterful machine politician, but he lacked nuance in his understanding of mass media. He refused permits for protesters, as if that would keep them from protesting and, therefore, prevent journalists from covering them. He had crude “We Love Mayor Daley” signs made, and had city workers to hold them up in front of the cameras. He stuck decals of himself on the phones in every delegate’s hotel room, which was a particularly dunderheaded move given that the city was in the middle of an electrical workers’ strike that made the phones all but useless.\\n\\nTo his advantage, however, was the fact that he had microphone access whenever he wanted it. But at a key moment, he pointedly chose not to take the mic. When Ribicoff made his crack about “Gestapo tactics in the streets of Chicago” from the dais, Daley stood up and shouted from the floor “Fuck you, you Jew son of a bitch, you lousy motherfucker, go home!” The forceful exclamation, shown on live TV, was later deciphered by lip readers. Friends said Daley called Ribicoff not a “fucker,” but a “faker.” Enemies suggested he had called him not a “Jew” but a “kike.” The CBS newsman who was closest simply reported that Daley had gone bright red with anger.\\n\\nAt age 66, Daley was not a man of the TV era. He was certainly not plugged into the fact that the Democratic convention had become not only a political event, but also a TV show. The conventions had been telecast since 1948, when so few Americans had sets that the coverage made little difference in how the parties presented themselves. Delegates were barely visible through clouds of tobacco smoke, and the floors were knee-deep in discarded newspapers. By 1960, the year that, as per Theodore White’s Pulitzer Prize-winning book, television had won the election for John F. Kennedy, convention organizers were fully aware that they were putting on a production. It’s incredible, but true, that eight years later, Mayor Daley didn’t know—or didn’t care—that hurling obscenities at Ribicoff on national TV might backfire on him.\\n\\nDaley had erred not only in his megalomaniacal self-promotion and encouragement of police brutality, but also in putting extra effort into controlling the TV networks. They did not get enough floor passes. They could not park their news vans where they needed them. They could broadcast live only from within the amphitheater. When a UPI messenger was roughly tossed out for no reason, in a typical “episode of strong arm tactics,” Cronkite observed that “about the worst thing you can say to these people here is that you’re from the press, apparently. They don’t recognize that as any sort of a pass.” Obviously, he objected specifically to physical assaults on reporters, but he was more generally disturbed by the contempt and lack of professionalism on the part of Daley’s goons.\\n\\n***\\n\\nWhat was the evidence of media bias in Chicago? The anchors called those bloodied in the streets “protesters,” “anti-Vietnam activists,” “young people” and “hippies,” while Daley insisted they were all “terrorists.” Further, Daley complained that no violent provocation on the part of said “terrorists” was shown. But the networks had kept a keen eye out, and insisted that they had not witnessed any. The footage played incessantly over the past 50 years has certainly not exculpated the police and National Guardsmen.\\n\\nNotably, however, additional disturbing footage that hasn’t been replayed since 1968 adds nuance to our understanding of the networks’ coverage. Two CBS sequences in particular stand out:\\n\\nIn one contentious late-night interview, Dan Rather pressed a jolly, red Thermos cup-swigging Mayor Daley about the smothering presence of troops downtown, a presence confirmed by images CBS flashed on the screen at precisely this moment. Daley characterized the report about the troops as “propaganda by you and your station and a lot of Eastern interests.” Complaint letters from all over America would attack CBS for being unfair to Daley, and no doubt many were disgruntled by the fact that CBS had intercut the Daley interview with footage of the guardsmen. But the network was simply making a perceptive editorial choice. Daley would neither confirm nor deny a fact for which there was clear visual evidence. If CBS hadn’t cut to the footage, it would have been Rather’s word against Daley’s. By cutting away, CBS showed that simply calling something “propaganda” did not make it so.\\n\\nA second, more visceral example of supposed editorial “bias” took place 15 minutes after the delegates left the hall, at the end of the convention’s harrowing third day. Cronkite suggested that some footage shot earlier “perhaps describes most symbolically the situation in the city tonight.” Explicitly declining to add a voice-over, he said “It seems to us that these pictures speak for themselves.”\\n\\nThe film showed a respectable-looking, middle-aged woman who had stopped her two-door sedan in the street to scoop up as many tear-gassed demonstrators as she could. They are clearly strangers to her. She immediately finds that the National Guardsmen have surrounded her car and will not let her pass. The faceless, gas-masked guardsmen point their bayonets at her tires, as if to slash them. Then, one of them points a large weapon into her car, just a few inches from her head. Cronkite had eschewed narration, but here interjects a quick explanation that this is, in fact, a grenade launcher. The Good Samaritan protests: “I just want to get them out of here so they won’t cause you any trouble.” More tear gas is suddenly released, without warning, and she rolls up her windows. A young businessman in coat and tie rushes past the camera, in agony. It’s a four-minute scene that seems to last an eternity.\\n\\nCronkite responded with passionate neutrality. “Ultimately the woman was permitted, as you saw, to turn around the car, drive away from the area. You saw the whole episode from the beginning to the end. … We do not know whether the young people were wanted for anything. ... We saw the episode, at any rate.” His point was that such drama simply needed to be seen to be understood. The scene spoke directly to Cronkite’s own demographic: the white, middle-class professional. This woman was not a troublemaker or a hippie. What the hell was going on?\\n\\nOver the horrific nighttime scenes shown earlier, Cronkite had said, “The interesting thing about this is that almost universally the bystanders have been horror stricken apparently by this action of the police. ... We’ve had a lot of telephone calls and complaints from people who saw scenes and wanted to report some of them, people of substance in the community.” Including the grenade launcher footage was a choice that even Cronkite himself could not have seen as completely neutral: It purposely made a point about the intensity of the violence. But to him, and his network, this was not bias—just good reporting.\\n\\nThe next day, Cronkite interviewed Daley in an exchange that Douglas Brinkley would later describe as “the low-water mark” of Cronkite’s career. During the “interview,” Cronkite mostly just sat and listened while the mayor defended his actions. Having been accused of bias by telegrams and phone calls streaming in since CBS had gone off-air the night before, a wounded Cronkite attempted to cloak himself in professional neutrality. He closed out by suggesting that he and the mayor had not come to “a complete meeting of the minds” as to how the Michigan Avenue situation could have been handled differently, and Daley responded, “we never will, but that shouldn’t be any reason why we can’t be friends.” They shook hands, and Daley departed. They were not friends, of course, and would not be. Any implication to the contrary was as phony as a $3 bill. The feeble exchange had laid bare the limits of “journalistic balance” and pre-cable news “cordiality.”\\n\\nAfter the convention, Daley demanded airtime to respond to what he considered unfair coverage. CBS got out of it precisely because the network had already given him the softball interview with Cronkite. NBC offered the mayor time on their panel discussion shows, which he declined. Finally, he commissioned an hourlong film that aired nationwide on TV and radio and focused on inflammatory comments made by activists before the convention and defensive comments made by police afterward. It wasn’t very convincing, but Daley had had his say, and the Federal Communications Commission’s notions of fairness had been satisfied.\\n\\n***\\n\\nBy early October of 1968, CBS received 8,670 letters about Chicago, and 60 Minutes’ Harry Reasoner reported that the mail ran 11-to-1 against the network. A viewer in Ohio wrote, “I’ve never seen such a disgusting display of one-sided reporting in all of the years I’ve watched television.” From South Carolina, a letter writer griped, “Your coverage was … slanted in favor of the hoodlums and beatniks and slurred the police trying to preserve order.” A North Carolina viewer complained that, “When a great network refers to trouble makers as THESE YOUNG PEOPLE and in such a … tender tone, that is bias.” A New Yorker even suggested that the police had engaged in righteous violence: “Our Lord whipped the money lenders out of the temple. Are you going to accuse Him of brutality?”\\n\\nThe notion that simply showing police violence was evidence of liberal bias didn’t begin with Chicago. It traces back rather directly to TV coverage of civil rights, when white Southerners complained that the networks ignored their perspective and were manipulated by publicity seekers within the movement. By the late 1950s, many of the same people who would later object to the network’s coverage in Chicago had already taken to calling CBS the “Communist” or “Coon” or “Colored Broadcasting Company.” The same bigoted wordplay made NBC the “Nigger Broadcasting Company.” Alabama’s Bull Connor summed up the situation with an aphorism that wouldn’t seem out of place in some conservative circles today: “The trouble with this country is communism, socialism and journalism.”\\n\\nIf the idea of network coverage being driven by liberal bias wasn’t new to the 1968 convention, the heat and undeniable violence of the convention was a perfect opportunity for white, conservative, middle Americans to coalesce in their resentment—and not just in the South, but across the nation. America was falling apart at the seams, and the network news was seen as complicit by virtue of recording what was happening.\\n\\nOver time, the Chicago convention has been reduced from the complicated four-day event that it was to the horrific scenes of street violence that took place there. Indeed, the pantheon of traumatic, iconic images of the 1960s could be boiled down to Cronkite reporting JFK’s death; urban riots, in Watts, Newark and beyond; Bobby Kennedy’s assassination; coverage of King’s assassination; the victims of the My Lai Massacre, a Vietcong being shot in the head by a South Vietnamese officer, and a naked, child running, covered in napalm; and the Chicago convention “police riot,” with its helmeted shock troops.\\n\\nNarrative, of course, is how we make sense of history. But this sort of pastiche can make it all too easy for us to ignore what’s jarring or contradictory, and it flattens our understanding of a period as rich with contradiction and factionalism as our own. The reactionary voices of the 1960s don’t ring as loudly in our historical memory as the more progressive ones, and that leaves us unduly caught off-guard when they reappear at the front of our national consciousness—as any shell-shocked liberal would have attested on November 9, 2016.\\n\\nJournalists face very different challenges than they did in Chicago in 1968, but as the president vilifies the media as “the enemy of the people,” and reporters have occasion to attend his rallies with a security detail in tow, it’s clear that the specter of violence still looms large. There is also ferocious disagreement over the meaning of what we view on social media or television, a disagreement that clearly is not native to our own time. What is obvious to some is not to others, who would contend, for example, that “truth is not truth.”\\n\\nThe violent images of Chicago that have dominated our cultural narrative of the event leave out so much more than they show. By re-examining media coverage of that event, we can understand better not only America’s past, but also the forces that define so much of our present and are unlikely to be absent from our future.\\n\\nHeather Hendershot is a professor of film and media at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and is the author of Open to Debate: How William F.

Debates over its merits were mostly limited to obscure blogs, niche magazines and political parties on the other side of the Atlantic. But more recently Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and a handful of other politicians have breathed new life into the label, injecting a radical alternate vision for the U.S. economy into the mainstream political debate. Ahead of the midterms, politicians like Ocasio-Cortez, Michigan’s Rashida Tlaib, and Kansas’ James Thompson have proudly held up their endorsements from Democratic Socialists of America, the country’s largest socialist group, whose numbers have swelled since Sanders’ 2016 presidential campaign.\\n\\nFor Fox News viewers, it’s the stuff of nightmares—not to mention that skittish Democrats fear alienating swing voters more comfortable with their party’s post-Lyndon B. Johnson incrementalism. According to a poll from August, however, for the first time since Gallup has asked the question, more Democrats approve of socialism than of capitalism. Could socialism really come to America—and what would it look like? Politico Magazine invited a group of socialist writers, policy wonks and politicians (and a few critics) to weigh in, and their responses were as diverse as the movement itself—reflecting, if nothing else, the expanded political horizons of our post-Trump brave new world. —Derek Robertson\\n\\nStory Continued Below\\n\\n***\\n\\nIf it’s good enough for the Nordics, it’s good enough for us.\\n\\nMatthew Bruenig is the founder of the People’s Policy Project, a progressive think tank.\\n\\nOne way to implement socialism in the United States would be to copy many of the economic institutions found in the Nordic countries of Denmark, Finland, Sweden and Norway. These countries, which consistently rank near the top of the world in happiness, human development and overall well-being, have highly organized labor markets, universal welfare states and relatively high levels of public ownership of capital.\\n\\nTo move in the Nordic direction, the United States should promote the mass unionization of its workforce, increase legal protections against arbitrary termination and allow workers to control some of the seats on the corporate boards of the companies they work in, as Senator Elizabeth Warren has recently suggested.\\n\\nWhen it comes to the welfare state, the country should create a national health insurance system, akin to some Democrats’ “Medicare for All” proposals, extend new parents paid leave from work, provide young children free child care and pre-K, and give each family a $300 per month allowance per child. The United States should also provide housing stipends to those on low incomes and increase the minimum benefits for those on senior and disability pensions.\\n\\nTo increase public ownership over capital, the government should establish a social wealth fund and gradually fill that fund with capital assets purchased on the open market. Over time, the returns from this fund could be parceled out as universal payments to every American, or used for general government revenue. The government should also build at least 10 million units of publicly owned, mixed-income social housing, which would both increase public ownership of the U.S. housing stock and provide a much-needed boost to the housing supply in prohibitively expensive metropolitan areas.\\n\\n***\\n\\nDemocratic socialism is about expanding democracy.\\n\\nDavid Duhalde is the senior electoral manager for Our Revolution, the Sanders-inspired progressive nonprofit.\\n\\nThe often-ignored core of how we would implement socialism is the expansion of who makes decisions in society and how, including the democratic ownership of the workplace. Democratic socialism in the United States is as much about expanding democracy as it is anything else.\\n\\nIn the short term, socialists, like liberals, want to protect, strengthen, and expand social services and public goods. We do so, however, not just because those programs are humane, but to move us toward a social democracy where people’s lives are less bound to the whims of the so-called free market. Universal health care and a jobs guarantee, two seemingly radical ideas that are in fact currently before the Senate, would be just the first steps toward social democracy.\\n\\nEstablishing democratic socialism means democratizing ownership of capital, our jobs and our personal lives. Socialists believe that if you work somewhere, you should have a say it in how it’s run. Through unions, worker councils and elected boards, this is possible at the company level today. Furthermore, if your labor generates profit, under socialism you would have an ownership stake and a democratic say in how your workplace is run. Co-ops and public enterprises like Mandragon in the Basque country, Cooperation Jackson in Mississippi and Red Emma’s in Baltimore give us a partial glimpse into what such ownership could look like. This type of democratized economy would grant autonomy to historically neglected communities, and it would be the foundation of any socialist United States.\\n\\n***\\n\\nCall it what you want, it’s about making communities more equal.\\n\\nRashida Tlaib is the Democratic candidate for Michigan’s 13th Congressional District.\\n\\nSocialism, to me, means ensuring that our government policy puts human needs before corporate greed and that we build communities where everyone has a chance to thrive. I’m resistant to labels, even ones that might obviously describe me, like “progressive,” because I feel like once the media starts defining you, instead of letting your actions speak volumes, you start to lose a bit of who you are. I’m proud to be a member of the Metro Detroit DSA because they are working for the same things I’m working for—a living wage for all people, abolishing ICE and securing universal health care, to name just a few.\\n\\nWe’re trying to create communities where the education you have access to, or the jobs you’re able to get, don’t depend on your zip code or your race or gender. People aren’t looking for a “progressive” or a “democratic socialist” representative, necessarily, but they also aren’t scared of those words—they’re just looking for a fighter who will put their needs ahead of corporate profits and never back down. So, if other people want to call me a democratic socialist based on my fighting for public goods that make us all better off, that’s fine with me, and I certainly won’t tell them otherwise. But I define myself through my own unique lens—I’m a mother fighting for justice for all. Ultimately, I’m trying to build coalitions and inspire activists to create a society where everyone has a chance to flourish. That’s the socialism I’m interested in.\\n\\n***\\n\\nSocialism would remedy the systemic deprivation of people of color.\\n\\nConnie M. Razza is director of policy and research at the think tank Demos.\\n\\nA more democratically socialist—or equitable—American economy would require a re-engineering of the structures that have systematically stripped wealth and other resources from communities of color. To see these structures, one could look back hundreds of years to Europeans stripping land from Native Americans and enslaving Africans to till that land; one could look back just nine months to Republicans passing a tax cut to benefit their big-money donors at the expense of the working and poor people.\\n\\nAdditionally, a new system would adjust how corporations are treated, recognizing what is already true: We invest in corporations and the infrastructure they rely on because they should serve us. With the current mood for deregulation and cutting taxes, we’ve shifted power to corporations. Appropriate regulation and fair taxation help business to pool resources—whether money (as in finance), power (as in energy companies), technology, food—and distribute them where they truly need to go.\\n\\nCrucially, an equitable future requires that everyone has an equal say in American democracy—equal ease in access to voting, free of overly restrictive hurdles. Smart public financing would enable voters to participate meaningfully by donating to candidates and enable all qualified citizens to run for office. Money should not give the wealthy extra votes. A more balanced political economy would recognize that only speech is speech, and the opportunity to influence the thinking of representatives is through the soundness of ideas.\\n\\n***\\n\\nDemocratic socialism means democratic ownership over the economy.\\n\\nPeter Gowan is a fellow with the progressive nonprofit the Democracy Collaborative.\\n\\nA democratically elected government should own natural monopolies such as utilities and rail transport; provide social services like health care, education, housing, child care and banking; and create a general welfare state that eliminates poverty through guaranteeing a minimum income, with assistance for people with disabilities, the elderly and families with children.\\n\\nBut we have to go beyond that. We need measures to establish democratic ownership over the wider economy, and eliminate our dependence on industries that rely on pollution and war for their existence. There need to be strategies to allow workers in the defense, aerospace and fossil fuel industries to repurpose their facilities for more socially useful production, drawing on the example of the Lucas Plan in Britain, where workers designed and published a viable “alternative corporate plan” that included funding for renewable energy, public transport and medical technology. We need a mechanism to transfer corporate equity into sector-oriented social wealth funds controlled by diverse and accountable stakeholders, which would gradually transfer ownership away from unaccountable elites and toward inclusive institutions.\\n\\nA democratic socialist America would be a society where wealth and power are far more evenly distributed, and it would be less cruel, less lonely and less alienating. Democratic socialism aims for the liberation of human agency and creativity—not just in America, but in all the countries that capital exploits and invades for the profits of our nation’s billionaires.\\n\\n***\\n\\nIt’s about giving everyone a voice in decision-making.\\n\\nMaria Svart is national director of the Democratic Socialists of America.\\n\\nOur collective power is the key to what socialism in America would look like, because democratic socialism rests on one key premise: We don’t have a blueprint, so expanding democracy to include all of us is both the means and the end.\\n\\nThe problem with capitalism is not just that a system fueled by a wealthy, profit-hungry elite is inherently unstable, or that it leaves whole layers of society starving in the streets. It is that it relies on the dictatorship of the rich. The fundamental difference we expect from a socialist society is that we will all have a voice in the decisions that impact our lives. Workplaces will be owned by the workers who run them, rather than an authoritarian boss.\\n\\nThe political system will be truly democratic, rather than run by those who have bought the politicians. Family life will be more democratic, and no one will have to depend on a breadwinner to survive because public services like health care will be available to all, and will be run with community oversight. Finally, government investment will be democratic, rather than decided by corporate donors or Wall Street gamblers. In other words, we will have true freedom, not just survival—the choices available to us now that depend on the whims of the few.\\n\\n***\\n\\nIt’s much simpler: social insurance.\\n\\nSamuel Hammond is director of poverty and welfare studies at the free market think tank the Niskanen Center.\\n\\nAlmost a century after FDR signed the Social Security Act into law, it remains his most enduring legacy, helping to keep more than 22 million seniors out of poverty each year—and protecting millions more from the risk of outliving their savings. And yet, we generally don’t think of Social Security as, well, “socialist.” But why shouldn’t we? Not only is it the federal government’s largest outlay—one third of the budget, at nearly $1 trillion per year—but its establishment signified that even the most rugged American individualist is ultimately bound to his or her fellow citizens.\\n\\nThe frontier spirit of American entrepreneurship, and the enormous heterogeneity that comes with being a nation of immigrants, means the United States will never have the high-trust brand of social democracy one finds in Northern Europe. Yet the success of Social Security provides a two-word hint for how America can become more “socialist” overnight: social insurance.\\n\\nSocial insurance is the public pooling of risks that markets struggle to contain, from pre-existing medical conditions to the sudden loss of employment. It can be done efficiently by any government competent enough to cut checks. And while the bureaucratic opacity of the Social Security Administration can be infuriating, it appears perfectly compatible with America’s low-trust brand of pluralism. This suggests that the path forward for American socialists is not occupying Wall Street, but the streets of Hartford, Connecticut—the nation’s insurance industry capital.\\n\\n***\\n\\nForget social democracy. America is ready for actual socialism.\\n\\nJoe Guinan is executive director of the Next System Project at the Democracy Collaborative.\\n\\nWhen socialism comes to America, it won’t be “one size fits all”—although it will have universalist aspects and aspirations. Rather than imposed from above, it will be bottom up, in line with America’s best traditions—able to draw, like the New Deal, on a rich tapestry of experimentation in state and local “laboratories of democracy.” It will be democratic, decentralized and participatory. It will be rooted in racial, gender and sexual justice, recalling Langston Hughes’ “and that never has been yet—and yet must be.” It will dismantle an already-existing American gulag—today’s racialized regime of mass incarceration, encompassing the largest prison population in the world—rather than imposing one. It will be about living safely, wisely and well within a flourishing commons, in solidarity with our nonhuman comrades, rather than overshooting ecological boundaries in the pursuit of financial accumulation.\\n\\nThis will be actual socialism, rather than social democracy or liberalism, because it will have socialized the means of production—although in plural forms that do not all center on the state. Instead of concentrated wealth, it will have broad dispersal of ownership. Instead of frictionless global markets, the rooted, participatory, recirculatory local economy. Instead of extractive multinational corporations, the worker, community and municipally owned firm. Instead of asset-stripping privatization, myriad forms of democratic public enterprise. Instead of private credit creation by commercial banks and rentier finance, the massive potential power of public banks and sovereign government finance—harkening back to Abraham Lincoln and Franklin D. Roosevelt.\\n\\n***\\n\\nA radical alternative to an American capitalist system that is anything but free.\\n\\nThomas Hanna is director of research at the Democracy Collaborative.\\n\\nA practical form of socialism in the United States in the 21st century would occur when democratic ownership displaces and supersedes the current, dominant extractive corporate model. There is no single, ideal form of democratic ownership, but an enormous variety including full state ownership, partial state ownership, local/municipal ownership, multi-stakeholder ownership, worker ownership, consumer cooperative ownership, producer cooperative ownership, community ownership and sustainable local private ownership.\\n\\nDespite all the rhetoric about the “free market,” the American capitalist system is anything but. It’s already reliant on a heavy dose of government policy, regulation, administration and accompanying interventions at various levels—in some cases even approximating soft planning, as in, for example, the farm sector. Some such mix of markets and planning will, at least at first, inevitably be a feature of an American socialist system, ideally with more democratic involvement in determining long-term national, regional and local priorities, on one hand. On the other, it will feature greater rationality in efforts toward more geographically equitable economic development—not to mention dealing with the increasing threat of climate change.\\n\\n***\\n\\nAmerica could turn into Western Europe. But should it?\\n\\nCarrie Lukas is the president of the Independent Women’s Forum. She lived in the European Union for the majority of the past decade.\\n\\nWhen Americans talk about socialism, they typically aren’t referring to government seizing property and taking control of industry. Rather, they mean more aggressive and redistributive policies, with more regulation and higher taxes to fund more generous welfare services—similar to policies already implemented in Western Europe.\\n\\nWhile this path is clearly preferable to more extreme versions of socialism, Americans should still be wary. Higher taxes and more generous welfare services discourage work and invite people to rely on the state. Countries with strong cultures of work and personal responsibility are held up as examples of how this system can succeed, but these are the exceptions; high unemployment rates and lower incomes are the norm.\\n\\nAmericans also face unique budgetary concerns: Europe has been able to forgo massive spending on defense and national security largely because of the role the U.S. military plays in our global alliances. The United States has no such guaranteed backstop. Meaningfully cutting defense spending will make not just our country, but the world, less secure.\\n\\nJust as importantly, Americans ought to consider how welfare-state socialism undermines people’s basic gumption. Europeans can hardly bother to reproduce, are less charitable, have less civic engagement and are less entrepreneurial than Americans. American innovation, risk-taking and our fundamental commitment to leaving the next generation better off than the last would all be jeopardized if we embrace European socialism. These are the virtues we would undoubtedly miss the most.\\n\\n***\\n\\nA complete welfare state, a transformed labor market and state ownership of the means of production.\\n\\nRyan Cooper is a national correspondent for The Week.\\n\\nThe moral motivation for a move to socialism is egalitarianism, taken from John Rawls or Jesus Christ or whomever. The basic objective would be to harness the wealth developed by the collective operation of the economy on behalf of the entire population, because it is unjust for a tiny elite minority to hoover up a gigantic fraction of income and wealth while millions are destitute or just scraping by.\\n\\nIn general, there are three main socialist policy objectives that make the most sense. The first is a complete welfare state, in which the state will catch every category of person who either falls out of work or cannot work—the unemployed, children, students, elderly, disabled, carers and so on. Once complete, the welfare state removes the capitalist compulsion to work by threat of destitution, and replaces that threat with the offer of job placement, training and so forth. Second would be a radically transformed labor market, in which virtually all workers are unionized and covered by union contracts, wage differentials between skilled and unskilled are sharply compressed, and workers hold perhaps 33 percent to 50 percent of corporate board seats. Third is the direct state ownership of the means of production, either through building up productive state enterprises, nationalizing certain key companies, or scooping up large swathes of corporate equity into a social wealth fund (as Alaska has done).\\n\\nThis last one is the most radical but, I think, necessary to really hammer down inequality. A third of all national income goes to capital, ownership of which is increasingly concentrated. Indeed, all the top 1 percent income growth since 2000 has come from capital.\\n\\n***\\n\\nMarkets are not enough to solve the problems we face.\\n\\nSean McElwee is a writer and the co-founder of Data for Progress.\\n\\nSocialism is the radically simple idea that democratic values should guide our economy toward the maximization of human flourishing, rather than the accumulation of capital. We would never accept decisions about our government being made exclusively by old rich white men, and we shouldn’t accept decisions about our economy being made that way. Historically, rich white men as a group have not been the best stewards of the common interests of humanity.\\n\\nWhen our economy is not democratic, it’s impossible for our government to be. We cannot steer our society toward maximum well-being as efficiently as the interests of capital override the interests of our shared humanity. Take, for example, climate change: The math is simple. Our largest corporations have fossil fuel supplies that, if burned through, would push global concentrations of carbon to more than twice the dangerous threshold. The choice is simple: Humanity exists, and companies take a write-off, or companies maintain profitability and human life is extinguished.\\n\\nHow do socialists differ from liberal Democrats? First, socialists recognize that markets alone are not enough to solve the problems we face. In the current moment, the market capitalization of just a few large fossil fuel companies has been enough to override the will of not just American voters, but the international community. More of the economy must be taken out of the hands of markets—not just energy production, but health care, through socialized medicine. Second, socialists recognize that a welfare state built on imperialism is not a progressive goal. The United States, as many Democratic politicians like noting, is the wealthiest country in the world. That wealth is built on violence tantamount to murder on a global scale. It is the wages of empire. A socialist politics strives for a radical flattening of the global income distribution.\\n\\nSocialists believe that without democratic control of capital and an end to imperialism, the goals of progressivism will be left unfulfilled. Socialists argue that capitalism is incompatible with democracy. To those who disagree, we pose a simple question: which will be wiped out sooner—the market capitalization of ExxonMobil, or the city of Miami?\\n\\nThis article tagged under: Bernie Sanders\\n\\nSocialism', 'clickbait': array(['1'], dtype='<U1')}\n",

Might be for the best because he’s been known to make it all about him.\\n\\nDonald Trump gets to do things his way much of the time. He met with Kim Jong Un in Singapore and Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, got the tax cuts he wanted, and has played golf nearly a third of the days since he was inaugurated.\\n\\nFunerals are another story. When Barbara Bush was laid to rest in April, word went out that he was persona non grata. And now, as Senator John McCain lies in state in the Capitol rotunda before Saturday’s services at Washington National Cathedral, Trump has also been asked to stay home. On Friday, streams of mourners passed by the late senator’s casket. At the same moment, the president headed to North Carolina to raise money for two Republicans in tight races.\\n\\nStory Continued Below\\n\\nThese disinvites are hardly surprising. Who can forget Trump’s taunting Jeb Bush during the primaries as Low-Energy Jeb, or his declaration that McCain, who endured more than five years of torture as a POW, was not a real hero because he was captured. There aren’t too many ways of snubbing a sitting president, but this is one of them, and McCain, who planned every minute of his multiday memorial, wasn’t going to miss the chance.\\n\\nTo judge from Trump’s performance at the funeral of his own father, Fred, in June 1999, McCain made the right call.\\n\\nMore than 650 people, including Joan Rivers, Donald Trump’s ex-wife Ivana, and scores of politicians and other real estate figures, attended the service, held at Marble Collegiate Church in Manhattan. The longtime head pastor, Norman Vincent Peale, author of The Power of Positive Thinking, had died, but Fred Trump and his son Donald had remained firm adherents of Peale’s admonition to keep laser-focused on success. Early in the proceedings, then-Mayor Rudolph Giuliani offered a brief thank you to the man who had built homes for thousands of New Yorkers. Then Donald’s three siblings offered loving tributes to their father, and his nephew Fred Trump III spoke of his grandfather’s ongoing connection to ordinary people.\\n\\nAt an earlier wake for his father, Trump had recalled his father as “wonderful,” “the best,” “a fine man” who “gave us all a good start,” according to the New York Post. But when it came time to eulogize his father at the funeral, the focus shifted noticeably. He began by saying it was the toughest day of his own life. It was ironic, he said, that he’d learned of his father’s death right after reading a front-page story in the New York Times about the success of one of his own developments, Trump Place. He then enumerated all his other projects and said his father supported each one, and he finished by noting that on everything he’d ever done, Fred had known he would be able to pull it off.\\n\\nDecades earlier, Alice Longworth Roosevelt, the sharp-tongued daughter of Teddy, famously and fondly said of her father that he “wanted to be the corpse at every funeral, the bride at every wedding and the baby at every christening.” Presumably, she was overstating the behavior of our 26th president for effect. But as Donald Trump’s performance at his own father’s service proved, her words provide a remarkably apt description of our 45th commander in chief.\\n\\nThe funeral of Fred Trump wasn’t about Fred Trump; it was an opportunity to do some brand burnishing by Donald, for Donald. Throughout his remarks, the first-person singular pronouns—I and me and mine—far outnumbered he and his. Even at his own father’s funeral, Donald Trump couldn’t cede the limelight.\\n\\nThis wasn’t Trump’s only awkward funeral moment.\\n\\nIn 1986, after Roy Cohn, Trump’s longtime mentor and legal hit man, died of AIDS, Trump dutifully attended his memorial service. But he wasn’t a featured guest, according to Wayne Barrett’s biography of Trump. He “stood in the back of the room silently, not asked to be one of several designated speakers, precisely because those closest to Cohn felt he had abandoned the man who had molded him.”\\n\\nThe service was packed with every important New York pol and Page Six celebrity in the city, but Trump, who certainly was no stranger to the tabloids, kept a conspicuously low profile because he had broken ties with Cohn as Cohn became progressively sicker, transferring his legal business to other attorneys. Cohn, wounded, told friends shortly before he died that “Donald pisses ice water.”\\n\\nTrump has all but acknowledged that grieving doesn’t come easily to him.\\n\\nWhen his parents died—his mother died in 2000, one year after her husband—he said it was the closest he ever came to shedding tears. “I don’t believe in crying,” he said in 2005 to biographer Tim O’Brien. “… It’s just not my thing. I have nothing against it when someone cries, but when I see a man cry I view it as a weakness. I don’t like seeing men cry. I’ll give you an example. I never met John Gotti, I know nothing about John Gotti, but he went through years of trials. He sat with a stone face. He said, ‘Fuck you.’”\\n\\nMichael Kruse contributed to this report.\\n\\n\\n\\nGwenda Blair is the author of The Trumps: Three Generations of Builders And A President and an adjunct professor at Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism.\\n\\nThis article tagged under: John McCain\\n\\nDonald Trump', 'clickbait': array(['1'], dtype='<U1')}\n",

There are currently 206 seats where Democrats have the advantage, compared to 205 for Republicans. But more of Democrats’ seats are safely in their column when compared to Republicans, and national trends suggest the wind is at Democrats’ back.\\n\\nFor POLITICO’s race ratings, each of the 435 House elections, 36 Senate contests — and 36 governor’s races, too — is rated on a 7-point scale: Solid Democratic, Likely Democratic, Lean Democratic, Toss-Up, Lean Republican, Likely Republican and Solid Republican.\\n\\nHouse\\n\\nThe election cycle began with Republicans holding key structural assets in the battle for House control. But over the course of the past year-and-a-half, those advantages have gradually eroded.\\n\\nRepublicans started with a number of entrenched incumbents in seats that swung against the GOP in last year’s presidential election. The problem? Many of them — like Ed Royce and Darrell Issa in Southern California, Rodney Frelinghuysen in New Jersey, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen in South Florida and Dave Reichert in Washington state — chose to retire rather than run for reelection. Since incumbent members typically have more campaign cash in the bank and run stronger than candidates in open seats, it provided Democrats with a more even playing field than they might have otherwise had.\\n\\nAll told, more than 40 House Republicans aren’t seeking reelection, and Democrats already have the advantage in a number of these seats, including those currently held by Issa, Frelinghuysen, Ros-Lehtinen and Reichert.\\n\\nMany of the GOP incumbents who are running have their own problems. Fifty-six Republican incumbents were outraised by the Democratic challengers in the most recent fundraising quarter, and 16 of them trailed in cash on hand as of the end of June. One reason is that Democrats have been able to raise funds at a greater clip than past minority parties, in large part thanks to an unprecedented online fundraising network. Republicans are in better shape when it comes to outside money — Congressional Leadership Fund, the leading pro-GOP super PAC — had $73.3 million in cash on hand as of mid-July, its latest report with the Federal Election Commission.\\n\\nDemocrats also managed to chip away at another House GOP firewall: the maps under which the elections will be held. Nowhere is that more obvious than Pennsylvania: Republicans held a 13-to-5 advantage in the state’s congressional delegation at the beginning of 2017, but thanks to court-ordered redrawing of the districts, Democrats could capture a majority of the state’s House seats this November.\\n\\nMorning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign — weekday mornings, in your inbox. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\\n\\nThen there’s the national environment. Trump — his average approval rating is down to 42 percent — and the GOP are near-toxic at a national level. Democrats’ lead on the generic ballot, on average, is in the high-single digits.\\n\\nAll the math — national and at the district level — boils down to this: Roughly half of the seats Democrats need to pick up are already leaning in their column.\\n\\nFour seats currently in GOP hands are even classified as Safe or Likely Democratic — New Jersey’s 2nd District and Pennsylvania’s 5th, 6th and 17th districts. In New Jersey, national Republicans have cut loose the party’s nominee, Seth Grossman, over bigoted statements Grossman has made in the past. Pennsylvania’s 5th and 6th districts are poised to move into the Democratic column as a result of new, favorable district lines. In Pennsylvania’s 17th District, Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb has a consistent lead over GOP Rep. Keith Rothfus in a member-vs.-member contest.\\n\\nDemocrats have another 10 Republican seats leaning in their direction — their candidates are currently favored, though not assured of victory. Four GOP incumbents are at least slight underdogs: Barbara Comstock in Northern Virginia, Steve Knight in Southern California, Rod Blum in Eastern Iowa, Andy Barr in Kentucky. And Democrats are also favored to pick up seats where incumbents are retiring: Issa’s San Diego-area seat, Ros-Lehtinen’s Miami seat, Reichert’s Washington state seat, and a seat in southern North Carolina, where GOP Rep. Robert Pittenger lost his primary.\\n\\nOf the two-dozen seats rated as Toss-Ups, 23 are currently held by Republicans; just one, the southern Minnesota seat Rep. Tim Walz is vacating to run for governor, is held by a Democrat.\\n\\nSimilarly, of the 27 seats rated as Lean Republican, 26 are currently held by the GOP. Republicans’ best pick-up opportunity: the Minnesota Iron Range seat being vacated by retiring Rep. Rick Nolan.\\n\\nThere are some self-inflicted wounds for Republicans on the House map. Blum, whose seat is rated Lean Democratic, is facing an investigation by the House ethics committee. Virginia Rep. Scott Taylor’s campaign is under investigation for allegedly forging signatures on the qualification papers of an independent candidate that could siphon votes away from Elaine Luria, the Democratic nominee.\\n\\nTwo GOP incumbents are under federal indictments: New York Rep. Chris Collins and California Rep. Duncan Hunter. Republicans are trying to replace Collins — who said he doesn’t want to run again, even though he is the GOP nominee — on the ballot, but Democrats have promised to fight his removal. Hunter, meanwhile, is full-steam-ahead on his reelection bid in what would have otherwise been a safe GOP district.\\n\\nAll is not lost for Republicans: Some of their incumbents are in better-than-expected shape, given the Democratic lean of their districts. Reps. Carlos Curbelo (Florida), Will Hurd (Texas) and John Katko (New York) are favored to win reelection.\\n\\nDemocrats will make gains on Election Day, and a “wave election” is possible — though not yet guaranteed. An improvement in the national environment — combined with GOP outside groups’ hand-to-hand combat in some of these districts — can still result in Republicans’ saving their House majority.\\n\\nWith two months to go until Election Day, the House is rated as Lean Democratic.\\n\\nSenate\\n\\nRepublicans control 51 of the chamber’s 100 seats — or at least they will when former Sen. Jon Kyl takes the seat of late Arizona Sen. John McCain — and Democrats would need to net two seats in order to win back control. (Because Vice President Mike Pence breaks any ties in the chamber, a 50-50 Senate would still be controlled by Republicans.)\\n\\nThere are far more GOP opportunities on the board than chances for Democrats to pick up seats. Ten Democratic incumbents are seeking reelection in states Trump carried in 2016, while only Nevada Sen. Dean Heller is protecting a GOP-held seat in a Clinton state.\\n\\nOf the Democrats, North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp is the most vulnerable. Trump carried the state by 36 percentage points in 2016, and Republicans are confident Rep. Kevin Cramer will defeat her this fall. North Dakota is rated as Lean Republican.\\n\\nThe GOP also likes its chances to topple Indiana Sen. Joe Donnelly and Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill. Trump carried both states by just under 20 points. An NBC News/Marist poll out this week showed McCaskill deadlocked with her GOP challenger, state Attorney General Josh Hawley. Both races are rated as Toss Ups.\\n\\nThe Florida Senate race — which pits Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson against GOP Gov. Rick Scott — is also rated a Toss Up. As of early August, Scott had already spent $27.9 million on his campaign, and Democrats fear Nelson isn’t keeping pace. But Scott only won narrow victories in 2010 and 2014 — in great environments for Republicans — and the two candidates are still neck-and-neck, despite Scott’s early barrage.\\n\\nDemocrats are looking a little better in Montana and West Virginia — two other solid Trump states. In Montana, Sen. Jon Tester is ahead of state Auditor Matt Rosendale, though Republicans hope Trump can help peel voters away from Tester.\\n\\nThat’s also true in West Virginia, where the president is expected to travel frequently before November. But Sen. Joe Manchin leads state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey in the latest polling. Both Montana and West Virginia are rated as Lean Democratic.\\n\\nWisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin’s race against GOP state Sen. Leah Vukmir is rated as Lean Democratic, while three other Rust Belt Democrats are in the Likely Democratic column: Sens. Debbie Stabenow (Mich.), Bob Casey (Pa.) and Sherrod Brown (Ohio).\\n\\nAs for Democratic pick-up opportunities, two GOP-held seats are rated as Toss Ups: Arizona and Nevada. In Arizona — a state trending more Democratic over the past decade — the race between Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema and GOP Rep. Martha McSally is likely to go down to the wire.\\n\\nMeanwhile, in Nevada, Heller has held his own with Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen thus far, polls show.\\n\\nTwo GOP-held seats are rated as Lean Republican: Tennessee, where popular former Gov. Phil Bredesen is running against GOP Rep. Marsha Blackburn, and Texas, with Democratic Rep. Beto O’Rourke’s high-profile challenge of GOP Sen. Ted Cruz.\\n\\nBredesen is running roughly even with Blackburn in Tennessee, but Trump carried the state by 26 points in 2016. In Texas, Cruz is fully engaged and taking O’Rourke seriously.\\n\\nReclaiming the Senate requires Democrats to win all of the Toss Ups — and hold Heitkamp’s North Dakota seat. Or the party could lose North Dakota, but win all the Toss Ups and either Tennessee or Texas. Either way, it’s a tightrope walk at this point in the cycle. The Senate is rated as Likely Republican.\\n\\nGovernors\\n\\nDemocrats are likely to make gains in the number of governorships the party controls, a key pillar of the party’s plan to have more influence in policy-making — and the redrawing of political maps after the 2020 Census.\\n\\nTwo states that currently have GOP governors are now rated as Likely Democratic: Illinois and New Mexico. In Illinois, incumbent GOP Gov. Bruce Rauner is trailing Democrat J.B. Pritzker by a wide margin.\\n\\nThe race to replace Michigan GOP Gov. Rick Snyder is rated Lean Democratic: Gretchen Whitmer is a modest favorite over GOP state Attorney General Bill Schuette.\\n\\nOf the seven governors races in the Toss-Up column, all are in states currently helmed by Republicans: Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Maine, Nevada, Ohio and Wisconsin. In Florida, a Quinnipiac University pol l out Tuesday gave Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, the newly minted Democratic nominee, a slight advantage over Rep. Ron DeSantis.\\n\\nIn Wisconsin, two-term GOP Gov. Scott Walker is in the fight of his political life against state Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Evers.\\n\\nRepublicans are looking a little stronger in five other races the party currently holds, which are rated as Lean Republican: Arizona, Kansas, New Hampshire, Oklahoma and Vermont. The Alaska governor’s race is also rated as Lean Republican; the incumbent, Bill Walker, is an independent.\\n\\nThe GOP has a few pick-up opportunities from Democrats, though the Republican candidate is an underdog in all of them. Hawaii, Minnesota and Pennsylvania are rated Likely Democratic. Colorado, Connecticut, Oregon and Rhode Island are more winnable for Republicans, but each is rated Lean Democratic.\\n\\nTwo bright spots for Republicans: Massachusetts and Maryland. Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker’s reelection effort is rated as Safe Republican, even in the bright-blue commonwealth. Meanwhile, the race in Maryland is rated Likely Republican, with Gov. Larry Hogan holding a big lead in the polls over Democratic nominee Ben Jealous.\\n\\nThe topline: Democrats are favored to pick up three governorships from Republicans, while the GOP could erase the only independent from the map. But the seven Toss-Up states are all held by Republicans, and a Democratic wave could flip those into the blue column.\\n\\n', 'clickbait': array(['0'], dtype='<U1')}\n",

With Chicagoans weary of the violence playing out in their neighborhoods, frustrated with a struggling school system and blaming him for a series of tax and fee hikes, Rahm Emanuel faced a long, painful reelection slog with an uncertain payoff.\\n\\nStill, the city was stunned when the brash Chicago mayor, who has never lost an election, announced Tuesday that he was throwing in the towel.\\n\\nStory Continued Below\\n\\nEmanuel had a sizable fundraising advantage and was the favorite to win in a crowded mayoral field.

Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\\n\\nLongtime ally and confidant David Axelrod said the decision was gut-wrenching for Emanuel, a sharp-elbowed pol who carved out a role on the national stage and wasn’t built to back down from a tough challenge.\\n\\n“He agonized over it. He didn’t make a decision until the last week and finally had to be honest with himself about whether it was good for him and good for the city to sign up for another four years. It’s a tough decision to make,” Axelrod said in an interview. “I admire him for it. No one has ever doubted his energy or ambition for himself or the city. It was a thoughtful decision on his part to conclude this is the right time.”\\n\\nLayered on top of it all was the specter of Laquan McDonald, the Chicago teen who was fatally gunned down by Chicago police Officer Jason Van Dyke. The issue had haunted Emanuel for years — he was accused of suppressing a dash cam video showing the shooting until after his 2015 election. Protesters had taken to the streets in protest for weeks in late 2015, calling for the mayor’s resignation and at one point shutting down business on the ritzy shopping district the Magnificent Mile.\\n\\nVan Dyke’s trial on first-degree murder charges began Tuesday and — in addition to whispers of what evidence could emerge to further damage Emanuel — there was perhaps an even bigger political fear: that Van Dyke could be acquitted, unleashing another round of unrest in an already racially divided city.\\n\\nChallengers were already squeezing Emanuel on both sides of the issue. Lori Lightfoot, who headed a police reform panel in Chicago, has stoked the issue of deep racial and economic divisions in the city and blasted the mayor for overseeing a police force in dire need of change.\\n\\nAnother challenger, former Police Supt. Garry McCarthy, has curried support from police officers who felt alienated during the McDonald fallout and shunned a new round of reforms they say make it difficult to do their jobs.\\n\\n\"This has been the job of a lifetime, but it is not a job for a lifetime. You hire us to get things done, and pass the torch when we\\'ve done our best to do what you hired us to do,” Emanuel said during his City Hall announcement. “Today, the time has come to make another tough choice. As much as I love this job, and will always love this city and its residents, I\\'ve decided not to seek reelection.”\\n\\nEmanuel was deeply conflicted and spent weeks mulling his decision, according to several sources familiar with his decision, seeking counsel from longtime confidants and allies, including political adviser Larry Grisolano of AKPD, friend and businessman Michael Sacks, and his family.\\n\\nThe mayor also consulted with two former presidents for whom he worked in the White House — Barack Obama and Bill Clinton — a testament to his durability and political pedigree.\\n\\nAfter a stint in the Clinton White House, Emanuel became a popular Chicago congressman and was credited as the architect of the Democrats’ 2006 House takeover. He left the House at Obama’s request to serve as the then-president’s first chief of staff.\\n\\nBoth former presidents released statements thanking Emanuel for his service.\\n\\n“With record job growth and record employment over his terms in office, Chicago is better and stronger for his leadership, and I was a better President for his wise counsel at a particularly perilous time for our country,” Obama said. “I’ve been blessed to call Rahm my friend. Whatever he chooses to do next, I know he’ll continue to make a positive difference, just as he has throughout his career in public service.”\\n\\n“From the earliest days of my presidential campaign over a quarter-century ago, through my time in the White House; his service in Congress; as Chief of Staff to President Obama; and for eight vital years as Mayor, Rahm Emanuel has served with vision, purpose, principle, and impact,” Clinton said. “I believe he succeeded because he cares about people, policy, and politics. Even people who disagree with him strongly on some issues understand that.\"\\n\\nYet in recent months, despite the larger-than-life persona he crafted since he began his mayoralty in 2011, the political realities came into clearer view for Emanuel.\\n\\n“We have seen multiple polls both citywide and at the aldermanic level where the mayor was in a very difficult position politically,” said Jerry Morrison, a political operative with Service Employees International Union. “In some of these wards where he was getting 55 or 60 [percent in 2015], he couldn’t get out of the 30s. It was clear his political position had eroded.”\\n\\nEven if Emanuel won, he was likely staring at a rocky third term, with an altered landscape in his city council. A boisterous Progressive Caucus that has already done battle with the mayor is poised to pick up six to eight seats, Morrison said.\\n\\nWith Chicago still facing sizable pension debt, Emanuel could face demands for higher city employee wages, better benefits and broader union rights, while balancing demands from ratings agencies that want the city to cut costs and possibly raise taxes yet again.\\n\\n“Most big cities have become more and more progressive. You’ve got this political force from both sides now squeezing towards the middle, and it creates a lot of political pressure,” Morrison said. “That’s a difficult dynamic for any incumbent. That’s a difficult political vise to be in.”\\n\\nEmanuel’s announcement immediately set off a wild scramble in this fiercely political city, with scores of congressmen, aldermen and financiers mulling whether to jump into the race. It also set off panic across the Chicago business establishment, which had spent years investing in Emanuel’s political future, applauded his downtown redevelopment, credited him with rising tourism numbers and saw him as a driving force behind a record number of corporate headquarters relocations to Chicago.\\n\\nCalls also poured in to powerful state Democratic Party Chair Mike Madigan from different labor groups who were thrown by the news.\\n\\n“They’re wondering what this means,” said a Democratic strategist close to Madigan. “They don’t like change.”\\n\\nSome of the mayor’s staff were also taken aback. As of Tuesday morning, Emanuel’s campaign still planned an October staff retreat to prepare strategy.\\n\\n“We were going full steam until today,” a longtime Emanuel political aide said.\\n\\nAccording to another longtime political operative, at least eight high-profile Chicagoans are reaching out to donors, labor leaders and other political operatives about a possible run for mayor. Among the names already surfacing: former U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, U.S. Rep. Mike Quigley and retiring U.S. Rep. Luis Gutiérrez.\\n\\nEmanuel’s exit remakes the entire dynamic of the mayor’s race, Axelrod said.\\n\\n“You had 10 people defining themselves against Rahm Emanuel, and now whoever runs has to present a positive view of the city,” he said. “It’s not about beating Rahm. That’s probably healthy for the city.”', 'clickbait': array(['1'], dtype='<U1')}\n",
